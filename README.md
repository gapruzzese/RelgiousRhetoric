# God on the Ballot: Text Analysis of Religious Rhetoric in Nominating Convention Speeches, 1934-2024

This study investigates the role of religious rhetoric in shaping presidential campaign discourse in the United States, focusing on speeches from the Republican and Democratic National Conventions between 1932 and 2024. Drawing on text analysis methods, including frequency counts, term importance metrics (TF-IDF), and qualitative similarity analyses, this research examines differences in how Republican and Democratic candidates employ religious language over time. The findings reveal distinct patterns: Republican rhetoric frequently emphasizes Protestant Christian ideals and personal religiosity, aligning with conservative values, while Democratic rhetoric employs more inclusive, faith-centered language. Unexpected trends, such as alternating peaks of religious frequency between parties and a significant rise in religious rhetoric during Donald Trumpâ€™s 2020 campaign, suggest a complex interplay between electoral strategy, societal context, and party ideology. The study highlights the nuanced role of religion in American political discourse, underscoring its evolving function as a tool for voter mobilization and ideological expression.
