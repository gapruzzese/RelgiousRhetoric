# God on the Ballot: Text Analysis of Religious Rhetoric in Nominating Convention Speeches, 1932-2024

This study investigates the role of religious rhetoric in shaping presidential campaign discourse in the United States, specifically using speeches from the Republican and Democratic National Conventions between 1932 and 2024. Through the use of text analysis methods, like qualitative similarity and condordance analyses, frequency analysis, and term importance metrics (TF-IDF), this research examines differences in how Republican and Democratic candidates employ religious language over time. The findings are insightful and confirm many hypotheses posited by qualitative literature on the subject. Specifically, Republican rhetoric frequently emphasizes traditional Christian ideals and personal religiosity, aligning with conservative values, while Democratic rhetoric employs more inclusive, faith-centered language. Unexpected trends, such as alternating peaks of religious frequency between parties and a significant rise in religious rhetoric during Donald Trumpâ€™s 2020 campaign, suggest a complex interaction between electoral strategy, societal context, and party ideology. The study thus highlights the nuanced role of religion in American political discourse, examining its evolving function as a tool for voter mobilization and ideological expression.
