        "## God on the Ballot: Text Analysis of Religious Rhetoric in Nominating Convention Speeches, 1934-2024\n",
        "\n",
        "### By Gerard Apruzzese\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In the days leading up to the 2024 United States Presidential Election, Donald Trump’s vision for America in his second term was abundantly clear. On the forefront of his platform, Trump touted his new economic policy plan through the use of tariffs ([Richards and Kopack](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-plans-enact-new-tariffs-canada-china-mexico-first-day-offic-rcna181753)) and his infamous plan to deport over 10 million immigrants during his second term ([Kanno-Youngs](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-immigration-plans.html)). While these talking points were covered by nearly every major news outlet, little attention was paid to his continuous prioritization of conservative Christian activists at the end of his campaign. In many of his final rallies and meetings leading up to the election, Donald Trump made clear his plan to bolster and elevate the policy and ideology priorities of conservative Christian leaders ([Dias](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/trump-christian-religion.html)). From the appointment of televangelist and Trump’s personal pastor, Paula White, as a White House aide to the continuation of his White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, Donald Trump’s appeal to religious ideology is strong and consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the creation of the Bill of Rights, the United States government has codified a guise of separated church and state. As written in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the United States government is to stay secular, prohibited from creating any official State religion ([US Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)). However, in the past century, the role of religion in dictating American political decisions has only grown, fostering an environment in which the actions of Donald Trump do not fell out of the ordinary. In the history of the United States, there have only been two presidents who have not identified with a non-Protestant denomination of Christianity ([Sandstrom](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/01/20/biden-only-second-catholic-president-but-nearly-all-have-been-christians-2/)). While Protestantism is the plurality religion in the United States ([Newport](https://news.gallup.com/poll/224642/2017-update-americans-religion.aspx)), their nearly unchallenged success in presidential electoral campaigns is fascinating.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the domination of a specific religious ideology at the head of the American Government, a more in-depth analysis of how religious dogma has been communicated by prospective presidential candidates throughout the past century is necessary to draw a more illustrative picture of how religious rhetoric influences electoral decisions. Specifically, this study sets out to analyze the role of religious rhetoric across political parties and time in the United States. To do so, I employ a variety of methods of text analysis to analyze campaign speeches at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first term, in hopes of gleaning a more quantitative and detailed understanding of how religious rhetoric is employed by Republican and Democrat presidential candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Research Question\n",
        "How does the use of religious rhetoric at the presidential nominating conventions differ across party lines and over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hypotheses\n",
        "Given the existing qualitative literature analyzing religious rhetoric in politics, it can be hypothesized that appeals to religion by Republicans will be more often and explicit. It is expected that Republicans will use rhetoric in a predominantly monotheistic, Protestant Christian context with more direct references to their own religiosity. On the other hand, Democrat’s use of religious rhetoric is likely to be less denominations, engaging rhetoric more rooted in faith generally in a more diverse context. Specifically, it expected of Democrats to make calls to support individuals of all religions. In turn, there will be fewer specific calls to Christian doctrine, instead including more unifying language surrounding religious rhetoric, though likely still monotheistic in nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis here primarily employs transcripts of nominating convention speeches sourced from the University of California, Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project ([UCSB APP](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/)). For this study, the transcripts were web scraped from the American Presidency Project webpage by pulling the document URLs from the html code of each page of speeches under the Convention Speeches section of the Documents page. Using these URLS, the speech transcript was scraped alongside the speaker’s name and the date of the speech. In total, there are 58 speech transcripts spanning both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions from 1932 to 2024. The number of speeches per convention increases with time, the most coming from 2024. The speeches include speeches from the presidential nominee, their vice president, and other prominent key note speakers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To decide what qualifies as key religious terms, a variety of generative AI platforms, like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, were asked to compile a list of religious terms which were frequently used in political speeches. Using the results from the query, the study focused in on the following fourteen words to conduct the analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*faith, grace, spirit, virtue, redemption, salvation, providence, prayer, bless, heaven, hell, creed, prophet, and god*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis begins with a glance at concordance and similarity results. At first, this is done with no distinction by political party, building a foundation of the general contexts in which the religious terms are used. For a more in-depth analysis, the text is split into two blocks, each containing the entire body of text of all speeches at a respective Democratic or Republican Convention. This step allows for a cursory analysis at how the context in which the key religious terms are used differs across party lines. From here, the similarity analysis is utilized to examine which other terms in the speeches are used in a similar context to help assess the more qualitative hypotheses described above.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin the more quantitative portion of analysis, a frequency count of each key religious word in each convention speech is calculated. To get the most accurate and consistent estimate for each speech, the text is lemmatized and tokenized before counting. This allows for word roots to be emphasized; any past tense and pluralized versions of the above words are thus still included in the count. For the total frequency analysis, the total number of designated religious terms in each text is summed. The data is then collapsed by year and party, creating an normalized average count of religious terms per speech for each party and presidential election year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, to evaluate the importance of the listed religious terms in each speech, the term frequency-inverse document frequency will be calculated for each term using the sklearn package in Python. Specifically, the frequency at which a word appears in a certain speech is multiplied by the log of the inverse of the fraction of total speeches which contain that word plus one. Thus, if-idf will assign higher values to the religious terms in a certain speech which are used less frequently in other speeches. From here, the tf-idf scores for each religious word in each speech are summed. For the assessment of religious term importance, the mean total tf-idf score of religious terms for each party for each presidential election year are compared to understand how the utilization of religious terminology has evolved across time for both Republicans and Democrats.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results & Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*I.   Similarity and Concordance Analysis*\n",
        "\n",
        "When conducting the qualitative analysis using nltk.Text.similar(), there are a few primary differences between the use of religious rhetoric by Democrats and Republicans. First, when using the word ‘god,’ speakers at the Republican National Convention tended to use mentions of God alongside references to their candidates. The words used most frequently in the same context as the word ‘god’ in RNC speeches include ‘me’ and ‘president.’ By employing words which reference the identity of the candidate in similar ways, Republicans are using ‘god’ to refer to the holiness of their candidate. For example, when accepting his nomination at the 2024 RNC, Donald Trump stated “I felt very safe because I had God on my side,” employing rhetoric which positions him as a solider of the divine. On the other hand, usage of the word ‘god’ at the DNC came in more diverse contexts. Among the most frequently used words in a similar context by Democrats is more unifying language, like “all” and “everyone.” By using ‘god’ in this context, while still imposing religiosity onto the nation, speakers at the DNC were less focused on proving themselves to be religious. Instead, they used this rhetoric to paint an image of a one, divinely protected, America.  This affirms the expressed hypothesis which posited an expected diversity centered approach to using religious rhetoric.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example of the difference in utilization of religious rhetoric is reflected by the contexts of the word ‘prayer.’ The words used in similar contexts to ‘prayer’ at the RNC seem to emphasize tradition and hardship, specifically ‘history,’ and ‘struggle.’ This likely reflects a view by Republicans of prayer as a tool in times of hardship, while still emphasizing the need for a historic, traditional approach to religion. The centering of tradition is a hallmark of conservative religious ideology. When looking to the use of ‘prayer’ by Democrats, however, the focus is primarily forward looking. The use of words like ‘hope’ and ‘opportunity’ in similar contexts to prayer signifies the tendance of DNC speakers to use prayer as an aspiration or mechanism of improvement. Also consistent with liberal ideology, the emphasis on the future is indicative of the importance of innovation and progress in their platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "*II.   Frequency Analysis*\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, on the quantitative side, while the use of religious rhetoric is consistent with the ideological dogma of each party, the frequency and importance of religious terms by political party is less straightforward. First, frequency. While it was expected for RNC speakers to have consistently and increasingly more frequent religious rhetoric than Democrats, this is not the case. While in most years Republicans employed more religious rhetoric than Democrats, there are two trends which stick out. First, in Figure 1, from 1948 to 1972, there is an alternating cycle of peaks of religious frequency between parties. This could be because the parties are adapting to the behavior of the other during this period, manifesting in peaks which mimic each other with a four-to-eight-year lag.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, it could be hypothesized that this trend manifests due to electoral success; for example, the party who loses the election may be more likely to use religious rhetoric, implying a hypothesized link between using religious rhetoric and winning the election. Second, there is a dramatic drop and increase in frequency of religious rhetoric at the RNC, falling in 2016 and peaking at an all-time, all party high in 2020. This comes during the first of Trump’s three nominating conventions. The dip in frequency of religious rhetoric in his first term could be anticipated due to his platform as a businessman, but the peak sharp jump up in 2020 is fascinating. Perhaps due to the salience of the COVID-19 Pandemic, where many may have turned to religion for hope and comfort, Republican politicians could have sensed this shift in their voter base and responded accordingly.\n",

        "*II.   TF-IDF Term Importance*\n",
        "In addition to frequency of religious terms, an investigation into the importance of religious terms at each RNC and DNC since 1932 can elucidate how each party uses religious rhetoric to achieve its goals. Similarly, here it was expected that religious words would hold higher importance at Republican National Conventions than at the Democratic National Conventions. Figure 2 elucidates, from 1960 through 2000, this hypothesis is majorly correct, with the importance of religious terms at the RNC being equal to or higher than the DNC for the entire period, except for 1968. The stage for Nixon’s electoral success, the 1968 RNC had historically low importance of religious terms, likely due to Nixon’s denominational identity as a Quaker ([Quaker.org](https://quaker.org/legacy/athensga/history.html)) Given the insurgence of liberalism in the Quaker church during the civil rights movement, it is likely Nixon attempted to distance himself from his religious identity as he ran on a conservative platform ([Smith](https://academic.oup.com/book/26109/chapter/194106900)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly to religious frequency, there is also a stark contrast between the use of religion in Trump’s first and second presidential campaigns. In 2016, religious rhetoric had an all-time low importance at the RNC, lower than the DNC for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. However, in 2020, the term importance of religious rhetoric skyrocketed. Given the political climate of that election cycle, with elevated social unrest and the Covid-19 pandemic, republicans and Trump likely leaned into religious themes. Specially, there was debates in evangelical circles, a historically conservative voting bloc, regarding religious freedom amidst forced church closures during the pandemic ([Gjelten](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/837698597/opposing-forced-church-closures-becomes-new-religious-freedom-cause)). The salience of these debates may be part of the reason behind the spike, as Trump relied on this block for his success in 2016, though without much pandering using religious rhetoric at the 2016 RNC.\n",

        "#### Looking Forward\n",
        "\n",
        "This report provides a preliminary glance into how text analysis and quantitative methods can be used in the field of religious studies and the sociology of religious, using the DNC and RNC as a case study into how religiosity has been communicated by both major political parties since World War II. While many of the results confirm qualitative prepositions regarding the interaction of the American Presidency and religion in the United States, the insights are not as consistent and straightforward as potential expected. Thus, a more in-depth and wide-ranging analysis of religious rhetoric in electoral campaigns using these methods is warranted.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, another step which could be taken with this database of speech transcripts is an extension of the analysis to include sentiment analysis and regression analysis. Sentiment analysis could aid in understanding the context in which religious terms are used by assigning a positive of negative sentiment value to each sentence in which a religious term is used. Applying this lens to RNC and DNC speeches might help give better hints to the reasoning behind using religious rhetoric by each group in each period. However, criticism of existing sentiment analysis packages posits that it often struggles to accurately interpret complex linguistic nuances like sarcasm and irony, increasing reluctantly in its application to this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, regression analysis could help assess more complex relationships quantitatively, in more interpretable terms. The struggle with TF-IDF is the difficulty in interpreting the numerical output of the analysis. Regressions could solve this by using different functional forms like natural logarithms to interpret changes in religious term importance as a percent. For example, correlational regression analysis could be employed to assess the relationship between the importance or frequency of religious rhetoric and electoral success. The results from this could prove interesting, shedding light on if religious rhetoric is truly associated with better performance in elections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to apply and analyze how religious rhetoric is used throughout the campaign trail. Using campaign event speech transcripts at speeches across the country, a spatial analysis of religious rhetoric on the trail could elucidate the unique functionality appealing to religion holds among different geographic regions of the United States. For example, do states with higher religious service attendance see similarly higher rates of religious rhetoric by presidential candidates at events in their states? The results from the analysis could help better understand if the usage importance of religious rhetoric in presidential campaigns is a response to desires of their prospective constituency.\n"

[Applause.] Thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. [Applause.] Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. [Applause.] Okay, lets get to business. Lets get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but Im no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know shes looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They \\u2014 they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin \\u2014 [applause]; and wherever our parents jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music \\u2014 Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, \\\"Stay close.\\\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \\\"Run, Kamala, run. Dont be afraid. Dont let anything stop you.\\\" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess \\u2014 and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated \\u2014 with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child \\u2014 as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for womens health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us \\u2014 and she always \\u2014 she also taught us \\u2014 and she also taught us \\\"and never do anything half-assed.\\\" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- \\u2014 Constance Baker Motley \\u2014 those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didnt want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor \\u2014 to protect people like Wanda \\u2014 because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: \\\"Kamala Harris, for the people.\\\" [Applause.] And to be clear \\u2014 and to be clear, my entire career, Ive only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with \\u2014 people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election \\u2014 and \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 and with this election, our nation \\u2014 our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 not \\u2014 not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred Americas fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my lifes work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And thats the fight we are in right now: a fight for Americas future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences \\u2014 but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider \\u2014 consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and separately \\u2014 and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider \\u2014 consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider \\u2014 consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know \\u2014 and we know what a second Trump term would look like. Its all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: \\u2014 we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting \\u2014 and we are charting a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to Americas success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And Ill tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. Thats why we will create what I call an opportunity economy \\u2014 an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end Americas housing shortage \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Not \\u2014 he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: \\u2014 up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax \\u2014 call it a \\\"Trump tax\\\" \\u2014 that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And lets be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \\\"I did it, and Im proud to have done it.\\\" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, Ill tell you, over the past two years, Ive traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is whats happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on womens miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask \\u2014 one must ask: Why exactly is it that they dont trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride \\u2014 [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis \\u2014 [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know \\u2014 I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, \\\"do whatever the hell they want.\\\" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russias plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response \\u2014 over 50 countries \\u2014 to defend against Putins aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israels right to defend itself \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump \\u2014 who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know \\u2014 they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump wont hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of Americas security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans \\u2014 fellow Americans, I \\u2014 I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go \\u2014 everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world \\u2014 that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us \\u2014 none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth \\u2014 the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.] So, lets get out there, lets fight for it. Lets get out there, lets vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.] Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]\",\n          \"Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \\\"Bob.\\\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. Were going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \\\"Tell us what happened, please.\\\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and youll never hear it from me a second time, because its actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which Im very lucky I didnt do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \\\"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\\\" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didnt move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isnt the reason that they didnt move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And theres an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, \\\"Why is there so much blood?\\\" He said, \\\"Its the ears, they bleed more.\\\" So we learned something. But they just \\u2014 They just, this beautiful crowd, they didnt want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didnt want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. Theyre incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassins life. Took him out. Im not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants \\\"Yes, you are.\\\"] Thank you. But Im not. And Ill tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didnt know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \\\"Fight, fight, fight.\\\" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, youve all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. Were never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and theyre going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days weve raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just \\u2014 called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \\\"Well, Im going to be sending a lot of money, but it cant compensate.\\\" They all said the same thing: \\\"Youre right, sir; we appreciate so much what youre doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\\\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now theyre doing very well. Theyre going to be OK. Theyre going to be doing very well. Theyre warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, \\\"We love Trump.\\\"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. Were going to turn our nation around and were going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens \\u2014 we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is whats been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity \\u2014 thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which Ive been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. Were going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldnt it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so \\u2026 I also want to thank my entire family \\u2014 Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasnt he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation hes had in about \\u2014 maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife \\u2014 very far away. I wont tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, \\\"Yeah, I wont be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I cant do it.\\\" And they came and they said, \\\"Dana wont be able to do it.\\\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \\\"Well, you know, thats too bad.\\\" But I understand, hes away and its good. Its good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \\\"Sir, Dana just called; hes going to do it.\\\" And his wife, she said, \\\"You cant turn him down. You just cant do it. You have to go.\\\" Thats a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now hes going to get on the plane in a little while and hes going to go back home to his wife. But theyre great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because thats not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \\\"I want to be a part of it.\\\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, hes amazing. Everyone loves him. I didnt even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think hes making so much money he doesnt know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and Ive known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. Thats Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. Hes a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called \\u2026 And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There arent a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by \\u2026 Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didnt want to really come up here. But he was so great. And hes such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. Theyve got to stop that because theyre destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, wed have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, hes good. I like his wife even better, by the way. Shes here. Thank you, Jason. But Im thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. Hes going to be a great vice president, hes going to be great. Hell be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \\\"Were going to try and stop MAGA.\\\" MAGA is \\\"Make America Great Again.\\\" What are you going to stop? Theres nothing to stop. Then they say, \\\"Oh, thats right.\\\" Its very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but hes going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., youre going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of \\u2014 oh, there they are. There they are, thats \\u2014 You are so easy to spot. And Green Bays going to have a good team this year, right? Theyre going to have a good team. Theyre going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesnt like it, but its true. Youre going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic \\u2026 development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. Ill be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. Were going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether youre a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobodys ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. Weve got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebodys terminally ill. And hopefully theres nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. Theyre terminally ill and they cant use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you cant do it. Theyve been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasnt that easy. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. They didnt want the risk. The labs didnt want to do it because if it didnt work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office \\u2014 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but its not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying \\u2014 just die \\u2014 we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where theyre not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. Theyre going to get it really fast, and whats happened is were saving thousands and thousands of lives. Its incredible. Right to Try. Its \\u2026 great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. Theyve never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and its taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. Its a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe whats happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. Its time for a change. This administration cant come close to solving the problems. Were dealing with very tough, very fierce people. Theyre fierce people. And we dont have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then theyre fierce. Then theyre fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what theyre doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy\\u2026 Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobodys ever seen before, and well end lots of different things. Well start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. Well do it more. Now, people dont realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. Well do it again, but well do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which Ive already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \\\"Oh, thats OK. We wont go to Congress.\\\" I call it an \\\"invasion.\\\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \\\"Im going to take a little of that money, because this is an invasion.\\\" And we built \\u2014 Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because whats more, whats better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country thats killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Were not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called \\\"Deface the Nation,\\\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \\\"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\\\" And they said to me, Well, I think thats about it. They werent going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that well never let happen again. The election result. Were never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. Were never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. Im not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that hes done to this country is unthinkable. Its unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and were going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. Its all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, were going \\u2014 Nobodys \\u2014 Nobody can believe it. You cant believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what youre making, it doesnt matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest theyve ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. Theyre not putting away anything. Theyre barely living. Theyre going into saving accounts. Theyre taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, its called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country thats suffered great inflation. Weve suffered the worst inflation weve ever had. But go back and see whats happened to those countries. Weve had the worst inflation weve ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. Its been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know whos taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know whos being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because theyre taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And theyre also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. Thats what it is. Its despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. Were going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed \\u2014 and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether youve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. Thats what were going to do. You dont even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. Theyre all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that theyve ever seen. Every single one. And its true. Its true. And theres love in the room. Theres great love in the room. So Id better finish strong. Otherwise, well blow it, and we cant let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, theres not one that I can think of where I said, \\\"Oh, gee, that wasnt great.\\\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Dont do that to me. Theyre already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was \\u2014 I think were actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a \\u2014 First of all, look at these crowds. Youd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, its about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for Americas renewal. And you saw that agenda, and its very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after theyre done. In their case, fortunately they dont read them because theyre pretty bad. Its a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. Were talking about just months. It cant come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. Its not affordable. People cant live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesnt matter what they are because you cant get the money anyway. Cant buy houses. Young people cant get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesnt. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. Id watch the \\u2014 and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? Thats all they talked about. This is the only administration that said were going to raise your taxes by four times what youre paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? Ive never heard it. Youre paying too much, were going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. Were going to give you more and its going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. Thats whats going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. Theyve spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. Its a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and theyre being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because were going to bring back car manufacturing and were going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. Were going to make them. We dont mind the \\u2014 We dont mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they dont agree with us, well put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. Theyve taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And were really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I dont even talk about it because of Covid. I dont even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years theyve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. Were going to get them all back. Were going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here its very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, Im staying in a nice one. Its called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where were leading by about 14 points. Hello. Ill see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And its a great building and the waitress comes over. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" Really nice person. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" \\\"Oh sir, its so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\\\" And she said, \\\"Actually,\\\" and I didnt know this, very little cash is given. Its all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money its just ridiculous. And they dont believe anything we say. Theyve just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, \\\"This shows the level of\\u2014\\\" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, \\\"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\\\" She said, \\\"What a great idea.\\\" I got my information from a very smart waitress. Thats better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. Its a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, theyre coming in. Theyre going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and youre not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and were going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst thats ever been seen anywhere in the world. Theres never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, hes incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they dont have to do anything but they want to. Theyre patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And theyre very tough people. But they dont want to do this job. Theyll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. Theyre the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries werent accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that were not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldnt take all the calls. \\\"Sir, sir, whats the problem?\\\" I said, \\\"You wont take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You wont take them back.\\\" \\\"Well sir, if youd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\\\" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldnt accept them. Theyd put planes on the runway so you couldnt land the plane. Theyd close the roads so you couldnt take the buses; theyd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \\\"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. Well take them back.\\\" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And were going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \\\"Look at, Im so proud of it.\\\" I think its one of the greatest \\u2014 it was done by the Border Patrol \\u2014 one of the greatest charts Ive ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. Thats pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \\\"Youve got to see this chart.\\\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But Im seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, thats the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, thats the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, its getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And were not going to do it. Were not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" We had a policy, \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \\\"You must give it to us. If you dont give it to us, there will be repercussions.\\\" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. Thats catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. Theres a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. Theyre coming from everywhere. Theyre coming at levels that weve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. Theyre coming from prisons. Theyre coming from jails. Theyre coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. Hed love to have you for dinner. Thats insane asylums. Theyre emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that weve never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because theyre taking their criminals and theyre putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but hes been getting great publicity because hes a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the countrys doing because their crime rate is down. And he said hes training all of these rough people. Theyre rough, rough, rough. Hes training them. And Ive been reading about this for two years. I think, \\\"Oh thats wonderful, lets take a look at it.\\\" But then I realize hes not training them; hes sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, hes sending them all to the United States. And hes different in that he doesnt say that. Hes trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesnt do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think were stupid. And they cant believe that theyre getting away with what theyre getting away with, but theyre not going to be getting away with it for long. Thats what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we wont be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because hes trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. Theyre down because theyre sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And youre seeing all the time. Thats why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation weve ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldnt believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyns heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachels mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. Ive also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people were talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. Hes a tough guy. The press doesnt like him because hes tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, whats happening, whats going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \\\"I dont want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\\\" But they said to him, \\\"Tell us, whats going wrong? Whats happening? What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Theres only one way youre going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\\\" True. He used a word I wouldnt use because I cant use that word. Because youd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \\\"He was a braggart.\\\" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said \\\"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\\\" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \\\"five years, sir, itll take five years, sir.\\\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. Its just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. \\\"How could you get along with him?\\\" Well, you know, its nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, youd say thats a wonderful thing. Now they say, \\\"How can you possibly do that?\\\" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. Hed like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. Were in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at whats happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. Hes running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really \\u2014 We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I dont think anybody has ever, what he did. Hes a real hero, a really great person. And hes running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. Were going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they werent doing things perfectly. So we said it doesnt kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didnt have one \\u2014 they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. Youve heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \\\"Why would you speak to him?\\\" I said, \\\"Because thats where the killing is.\\\" I dont have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: \\\"Dont ever do that. Dont ever do that again. Dont ever, ever do that again, youre going to stop.\\\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \\\"If you keep doing that, youre going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\\\" And he said, \\\"I understand, Your Excellency.\\\" He called me \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? Theyre selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, \\\"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\\\" I said, \\\"Youll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\\\" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. Its one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \\\"Whats Wrong With Our President?\\\". You dont even hear this. Youre not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They dont want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back \\u2014 and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I dont have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. Were going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and youre doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And theyre doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, \\\"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\\\" And the people at the shipyards said, \\\"This guy sort of knows what hes doing.\\\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but were going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are \\u2014 And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didnt have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we dont? No, no, were going to build an iron dome over our country, and were going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, Im going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. Its America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimers disease and many other diseases. Were going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I dont want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \\\"the 10 worst,\\\" I had to do it. I didnt want anybody to be confused. But this man said were going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. Were going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimers and so many other things. Were so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in womens sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nations once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nations capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things \\u2014 they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. Americas on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. Were going to take it, were going to make it a current \\u2014 I mean, were going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If were going to produce the new \\u2014 if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that were going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous \\u2014 literally, twice the electricity thats available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead were spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didnt work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If youre going to do this \\u2026 And by the way, Im all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, theyre going to be able to do it. And were going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. Its called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows Gods plan, or where lifes adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; hes an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \\\"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think its great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It wont make any difference. Please. Dont use any foul language.\\\" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \\\"It wont make any difference.\\\" Actually, it does, the storys not quite as good, but Ive been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. Ive got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. Hes a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies youve ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But hed get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklins been fantastic. And Im trying, Im just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. Im working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. Its your movement. Its the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It cant be stopped. It cant be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. Weve given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. Theyre not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And thats not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our countrys true potential \\u2014 and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. Its unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death \\u2014 and stared down those enemies \\u2014 to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many \\u2014 just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We cant forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful \\u2014 I think its so beautiful \\u2014 American flag.

Thank you.\",\n          \"Fellow Democrats, fellow citizens: I thank you for the nomination youve offered me, and I especially thank you for choosing as my running mate the best partner any President ever had, Fritz Mondale. With gratitude and with determination I accept your nomination, and I am proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammered out at this convention. Fritz and I will mount a campaign that defines the real issues, a campaign that responds to the intelligence of the American people, a campaign that talks sense. And were going to beat the Republicans in November. Well win because we are the party of a great President who knew how to get reelected\\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And we are the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give em hell\\u2014Harry Truman. And as Truman said, he just told the truth and they thought it was hell. And were the party of a gallant man of spirit\\u2014John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And were the party of a great leader of compassion\\u2014Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the party of a great man who should have been President, who would have been one of the greatest Presidents in history\\u2014Hubert Horatio Hornblower\\u2014Humphrey. I have appreciated what this convention has said about Senator Humphrey, a great man who epitomized the spirit of the Democratic Party. And I would like to say that we are also the party of Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Edward Kennedy. Id like to say a personal word to Senator Kennedy. Ted, youre a tough competitor and a superb campaigner, and I can attest to that. Your speech before this convention was a magnificent statement of what the Democratic Party is and what it means to the people of this country and why a Democratic victory is so important this year. I reach out to you tonight, and I reach out to all those who supported you in your valiant and passionate campaign. Ted, your party needs and I need you. And I need your idealism and your dedication working for us. There is no doubt that even greater service lies ahead of you, and we are grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a larger cause to which your own life has been dedicated. I thank you for your support; well make great partners this fall in whipping the Republicans. We are Democrats and weve had our differences, but we share a bright vision of Americas future\\u2014a vision of a good life for all our people, a vision of a secure nation, a just society, a peaceful world, a strong America\\u2014confident and proud and united. And we have a memory of Franklin Roosevelt, 40 years ago, when he said that there are times in our history when concerns over our personal lives are overshadowed by our concern over \\\"what will happen to the county we have known.\\\" This is such a time, and I can tell you that the choice to be made this year can transform our own personal lives and the life of our country as well. During the last Presidential campaign, I crisscrossed this country and I listened to thousands and thousands of people-housewives and farmers, teachers and small business leaders, workers and students, the elderly and the poor, people of every race and every background and every walk of life. It was a powerful experience\\u2014a total immersion in the human reality of America. And I have now had another kind of total immersion\\u2014being President of the United States of America. Let me talk for a moment about what that job is like and what Ive learned from it. Ive learned that only the most complex and difficult task comes before me in the Oval Office. No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there. Ive learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. Im wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago. And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans. The poor and the jobless and the afflicted-theyve become part of me. My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. The life of every human being on Earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the Oval Office. The Presidents power for building and his power for destruction are awesome. And the powers greatest exactly where the stakes are highest\\u2014in matters of war and peace. And Ive learned something else, something that I have come to see with extraordinary clarity: Above all, I must look ahead, because the President of the United States is the steward of the Nations destiny. He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory. And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And thats why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. Thats why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort. The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. Thats why the election of 1980 is so important. Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but its more than that\\u2014its a choice between two futures. The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight. The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace. I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone. I see a future of justice\\u2014the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America. And I see a future of peace\\u2014a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well. That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. Its the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose. But there is another possible future. In that other future I see despair\\u2014despair of millions who would struggle for equal opportunity and a better life and struggle alone. And I see surrender\\u2014the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk\\u2014the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race. No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party. The consequences of those commitments and policies would drive us down the wrong road. Its up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny. The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present. But while we Democrats grapple with the real challenges of a real world, others talk about a world of tinsel and make-believe. Lets look for a moment at their make-believe world. In their fantasy America, inner-city people and farm workers and laborers do not exist. Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions\\u2014simple and wrong. Its a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions\\u2014it sounds too good to be true, and it is. The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Lets take a hard look at the consequences of our choice. You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength\\u2014steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third. Weve reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since Ive been President weve had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force\\u2014all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms. The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers. The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass. Its simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia\\u2014the Moscow Olympics. The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldnt go along with that. He doesnt seem to know what to do with the Russians. Hes not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them. As I look back at my first term, Im grateful that weve had a country for the full 4 years of peace. And thats what were going to have for the next 4 years-peace. Its only common sense that if America is to stay secure and at peace, we must encourage others to be peaceful as well. As you know, weve helped in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia where weve stood firm for racial justice and democracy. And we have also helped in the Middle East. Some have criticized the Camp David accords and theyve criticized some delays in the implementation of the Middle East peace treaty. Well, before I became President there was no Camp David accords and there was no Middle East peace treaty. Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Now thats the kind of future were offering\\u2014of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall. I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights. Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think its naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for? Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II. Ask those who are suffering for the sake of justice and liberty around the world. Ask the millions whove fled tyranny if America should stop speaking out for human principles. Ask the American people. I tell you that as long as I am President, we will hold high the banner of human rights, and you can depend on it. Here at home the choice between the two futures is equally important. In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies. We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress. Now, after 3 years of struggle, we have that program. The battle to secure Americas energy future has been fully and finally joined. Americans have cooperated with dramatic results. Weve reversed decades of dangerous and growing dependence on foreign oil. We are now importing 20 percent less oil\\u2014that is 1 1/2 million barrels of oil every day less than the day I took office. And with our new energy policy now in place, we can discover more, produce more, create more, and conserve more energy, and we will use American resources, American technology, and millions of American workers to do it with. Now, what do the Republicans propose? Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that weve done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with. Thats one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to \\\"unleash\\\" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. Thats it. That is it. Thats their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No ! THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and well begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November. When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and weve met them all head-on. Weve slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and were now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. Weve increased our exports dramatically. Weve reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs\\u2014the biggest increase in the history of our country. But the road is bumpy, and last years skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, were struggling to bring inflation under control. We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, weve laid the groundwork for a new economic age. Our economic renewal program for the 1980s will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. Itll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals\\u2014lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs. Its time to put all America back to work\\u2014but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things well rebuild together and build together:\\u2014new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;\\u2014a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;\\u2014industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;\\u2014job training for workers displaced by economic changes;\\u2014new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;\\u2014better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;\\u2014and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy. This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen. We are talking about the United States of America, and those who count this country out as an economic superpower are going to find out just how wrong they are. Were going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980s a time of growth for America. The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us. Their partys own Vice Presidential nominee said that Reagan-Kemp-Roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. He called it \\\"voodoo economics\\\". He suddenly changed his mind toward the end of the Republican Convention, but he was right the first time. Along with this gigantic tax cut, the new Republican leaders promise to protect retirement and health programs and to have massive increases in defense spending-and they claim they can balance the budget. If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial\\u2014and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose. But the American people will not stand for it. The Democratic Party has always embodied the hope of our people for justice, opportunity, and a better life, and weve worked in every way possible to strengthen the American family, to encourage self-reliance, and to follow the Old Testament admonition: \\\"Defend the poor and the fatherless; give justice to the afflicted and needy.\\\" Weve struggled to assure that no child in America ever goes to bed hungry, that no elderly couple in America has to live in a substandard home, and that no young person in America is excluded from college because the family is poor. But what have the Republicans proposed?\\u2014just an attack on everything that weve done in the achievement of social justice and decency that weve won in the last 50 years, ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelts first term. They would make social security voluntary. They would reverse our progress on the minimum wage, full employment laws, safety in the work place, and a healthy environment. Lately, as you know, the Republicans have been quoting Democratic Presidents. But who can blame them? Would you rather quote Herbert Hoover or Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Would you rather quote Richard Nixon or John Fitzgerald Kennedy? The Republicans have always been the party of privilege, but this year their leaders have gone even further. In their platform, they have repudiated the best traditions of their own party. Where is the conscience of Lincoln in the party of Lincoln? Whats become of their traditional Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility? Whats happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control? Now, I dont claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I dont claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, theyve not all been easy. But I will say this: Weve been tested under fire. Weve neither ducked nor hidden, and weve tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. Weve made tough decisions, and weve taken the heat for them. Weve made mistakes, and weve learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future. Weve done something else, perhaps even more important. In good times and bad, in the valleys and on the peaks, weve told people the truth, the hard truth, the truth that sometimes hurts. One truth that we Americans have learned is that our dream has been earned for progress and for peace. Look what our land has been through within our own memory\\u2014a great depression, a world war, a technological explosion, the civil rights revolution, the bitterness of Vietnam, the shame of Watergate, the twilight peace of nuclear terror. Through each of these momentous experiences weve learned the hard way about the world and about ourselves. But weve matured and weve grown as a nation and weve grown stronger. Weve learned the uses and the limitations of power. Weve learned the beauty and responsibility of freedom. Weve learned the value and the obligation of justice. And we have learned the necessity of peace. Some would argue that to master these lessons is somehow to limit our potential. That is not so. A nation which knows its true strengths, which sees its true challenges, which understands legitimate constraints, that nation\\u2014our nation\\u2014is far stronger than one which takes refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Democratic Party\\u2014the American people-have understood these fundamental truths. All of us can sympathize with the desire for easy answers. Theres often the temptation to substitute idle dreams for hard reality. The new Republican leaders are hoping that our Nation will succumb to that temptation this year, but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the American people. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill came to North America and he said, \\\"We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\\\" We Americans have courage. Americans have always been on the cutting edge of change. Weve always looked forward with anticipation and confidence. I still want the same thing that all of you want\\u2014a self-reliant neighborhood, strong families, work for the able-bodied and good medical care for the sick, opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old, equal rights and justice for all people. I want teachers eager to explain what a civilization really is, and I want students to understand their own needs and their own aims, but also the needs and yearnings of their neighbors. I want women free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves. I want our farmers growing crops to feed our Nation and the world, secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of us. I want workers to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country. And I want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new ideas. And I want minority citizens fully to join the mainstream of American life. And I want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our Nation, and Im determined to do it. I need for all of you to join me in fulfilling that vision. The choice, the choice between the two futures, could not be more clear. If we succumb to a dream world then well wake up to a nightmare. But if we start with reality and fight to make our dreams a reality, then Americans will have a good life, a life of meaning and purpose in a nation thats strong and secure. Above all, I want us to be what the Founders of our Nation meant us to become\\u2014the land of freedom, the land of peace, and the land of hope.

Lets get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but Im no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know shes looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They \\u2014 they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin \\u2014 [applause]; and wherever our parents jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music \\u2014 Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, \\\"Stay close.\\\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \\\"Run, Kamala, run. Dont be afraid. Dont let anything stop you.\\\" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess \\u2014 and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated \\u2014 with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child \\u2014 as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for womens health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us \\u2014 and she always \\u2014 she also taught us \\u2014 and she also taught us \\\"and never do anything half-assed.\\\" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- \\u2014 Constance Baker Motley \\u2014 those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didnt want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor \\u2014 to protect people like Wanda \\u2014 because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: \\\"Kamala Harris, for the people.\\\" [Applause.] And to be clear \\u2014 and to be clear, my entire career, Ive only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with \\u2014 people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election \\u2014 and \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 and with this election, our nation \\u2014 our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 not \\u2014 not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred Americas fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my lifes work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And thats the fight we are in right now: a fight for Americas future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences \\u2014 but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider \\u2014 consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and separately \\u2014 and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider \\u2014 consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider \\u2014 consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know \\u2014 and we know what a second Trump term would look like. Its all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: \\u2014 we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting \\u2014 and we are charting a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to Americas success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And Ill tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. Thats why we will create what I call an opportunity economy \\u2014 an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end Americas housing shortage \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Not \\u2014 he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: \\u2014 up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax \\u2014 call it a \\\"Trump tax\\\" \\u2014 that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And lets be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \\\"I did it, and Im proud to have done it.\\\" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, Ill tell you, over the past two years, Ive traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is whats happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on womens miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask \\u2014 one must ask: Why exactly is it that they dont trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride \\u2014 [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis \\u2014 [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know \\u2014 I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, \\\"do whatever the hell they want.\\\" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russias plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response \\u2014 over 50 countries \\u2014 to defend against Putins aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israels right to defend itself \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump \\u2014 who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know \\u2014 they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump wont hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of Americas security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans \\u2014 fellow Americans, I \\u2014 I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go \\u2014 everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world \\u2014 that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us \\u2014 none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth \\u2014 the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.] So, lets get out there, lets fight for it. Lets get out there, lets vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.] Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]\",\n          \"Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \\\"Bob.\\\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. Were going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \\\"Tell us what happened, please.\\\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and youll never hear it from me a second time, because its actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which Im very lucky I didnt do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \\\"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\\\" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didnt move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isnt the reason that they didnt move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And theres an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, \\\"Why is there so much blood?\\\" He said, \\\"Its the ears, they bleed more.\\\" So we learned something. But they just \\u2014 They just, this beautiful crowd, they didnt want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didnt want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. Theyre incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassins life. Took him out. Im not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants \\\"Yes, you are.\\\"] Thank you. But Im not. And Ill tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didnt know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \\\"Fight, fight, fight.\\\" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, youve all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. Were never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and theyre going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days weve raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just \\u2014 called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \\\"Well, Im going to be sending a lot of money, but it cant compensate.\\\" They all said the same thing: \\\"Youre right, sir; we appreciate so much what youre doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\\\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now theyre doing very well. Theyre going to be OK. Theyre going to be doing very well. Theyre warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, \\\"We love Trump.\\\"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. Were going to turn our nation around and were going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens \\u2014 we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is whats been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity \\u2014 thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which Ive been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. Were going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldnt it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so \\u2026 I also want to thank my entire family \\u2014 Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasnt he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation hes had in about \\u2014 maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife \\u2014 very far away. I wont tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, \\\"Yeah, I wont be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I cant do it.\\\" And they came and they said, \\\"Dana wont be able to do it.\\\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \\\"Well, you know, thats too bad.\\\" But I understand, hes away and its good. Its good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \\\"Sir, Dana just called; hes going to do it.\\\" And his wife, she said, \\\"You cant turn him down. You just cant do it. You have to go.\\\" Thats a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now hes going to get on the plane in a little while and hes going to go back home to his wife. But theyre great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because thats not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \\\"I want to be a part of it.\\\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, hes amazing. Everyone loves him. I didnt even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think hes making so much money he doesnt know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and Ive known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. Thats Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. Hes a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called \\u2026 And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There arent a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by \\u2026 Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didnt want to really come up here. But he was so great. And hes such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. Theyve got to stop that because theyre destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, wed have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, hes good. I like his wife even better, by the way. Shes here. Thank you, Jason. But Im thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. Hes going to be a great vice president, hes going to be great. Hell be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \\\"Were going to try and stop MAGA.\\\" MAGA is \\\"Make America Great Again.\\\" What are you going to stop? Theres nothing to stop. Then they say, \\\"Oh, thats right.\\\" Its very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but hes going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., youre going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of \\u2014 oh, there they are. There they are, thats \\u2014 You are so easy to spot. And Green Bays going to have a good team this year, right? Theyre going to have a good team. Theyre going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesnt like it, but its true. Youre going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic \\u2026 development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. Ill be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. Were going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether youre a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobodys ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. Weve got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebodys terminally ill. And hopefully theres nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. Theyre terminally ill and they cant use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you cant do it. Theyve been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasnt that easy. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. They didnt want the risk. The labs didnt want to do it because if it didnt work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office \\u2014 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but its not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying \\u2014 just die \\u2014 we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where theyre not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. Theyre going to get it really fast, and whats happened is were saving thousands and thousands of lives. Its incredible. Right to Try. Its \\u2026 great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. Theyve never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and its taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. Its a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe whats happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. Its time for a change. This administration cant come close to solving the problems. Were dealing with very tough, very fierce people. Theyre fierce people. And we dont have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then theyre fierce. Then theyre fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what theyre doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy\\u2026 Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobodys ever seen before, and well end lots of different things. Well start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. Well do it more. Now, people dont realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. Well do it again, but well do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which Ive already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \\\"Oh, thats OK. We wont go to Congress.\\\" I call it an \\\"invasion.\\\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \\\"Im going to take a little of that money, because this is an invasion.\\\" And we built \\u2014 Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because whats more, whats better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country thats killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Were not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called \\\"Deface the Nation,\\\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \\\"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\\\" And they said to me, Well, I think thats about it. They werent going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that well never let happen again. The election result. Were never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. Were never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. Im not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that hes done to this country is unthinkable. Its unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and were going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. Its all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, were going \\u2014 Nobodys \\u2014 Nobody can believe it. You cant believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what youre making, it doesnt matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest theyve ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. Theyre not putting away anything. Theyre barely living. Theyre going into saving accounts. Theyre taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, its called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country thats suffered great inflation. Weve suffered the worst inflation weve ever had. But go back and see whats happened to those countries. Weve had the worst inflation weve ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. Its been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know whos taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know whos being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because theyre taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And theyre also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. Thats what it is. Its despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. Were going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed \\u2014 and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether youve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. Thats what were going to do. You dont even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. Theyre all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that theyve ever seen. Every single one. And its true. Its true. And theres love in the room. Theres great love in the room. So Id better finish strong. Otherwise, well blow it, and we cant let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, theres not one that I can think of where I said, \\\"Oh, gee, that wasnt great.\\\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Dont do that to me. Theyre already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was \\u2014 I think were actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a \\u2014 First of all, look at these crowds. Youd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, its about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for Americas renewal. And you saw that agenda, and its very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after theyre done. In their case, fortunately they dont read them because theyre pretty bad. Its a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. Were talking about just months. It cant come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. Its not affordable. People cant live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesnt matter what they are because you cant get the money anyway. Cant buy houses. Young people cant get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesnt. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. Id watch the \\u2014 and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? Thats all they talked about. This is the only administration that said were going to raise your taxes by four times what youre paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? Ive never heard it. Youre paying too much, were going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. Were going to give you more and its going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. Thats whats going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. Theyve spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. Its a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and theyre being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because were going to bring back car manufacturing and were going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. Were going to make them. We dont mind the \\u2014 We dont mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they dont agree with us, well put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. Theyve taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And were really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I dont even talk about it because of Covid. I dont even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years theyve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. Were going to get them all back. Were going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here its very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, Im staying in a nice one. Its called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where were leading by about 14 points. Hello. Ill see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And its a great building and the waitress comes over. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" Really nice person. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" \\\"Oh sir, its so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\\\" And she said, \\\"Actually,\\\" and I didnt know this, very little cash is given. Its all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money its just ridiculous. And they dont believe anything we say. Theyve just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, \\\"This shows the level of\\u2014\\\" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, \\\"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\\\" She said, \\\"What a great idea.\\\" I got my information from a very smart waitress. Thats better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. Its a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, theyre coming in. Theyre going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and youre not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and were going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst thats ever been seen anywhere in the world. Theres never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, hes incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they dont have to do anything but they want to. Theyre patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And theyre very tough people. But they dont want to do this job. Theyll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. Theyre the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries werent accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that were not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldnt take all the calls. \\\"Sir, sir, whats the problem?\\\" I said, \\\"You wont take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You wont take them back.\\\" \\\"Well sir, if youd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\\\" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldnt accept them. Theyd put planes on the runway so you couldnt land the plane. Theyd close the roads so you couldnt take the buses; theyd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \\\"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. Well take them back.\\\" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And were going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \\\"Look at, Im so proud of it.\\\" I think its one of the greatest \\u2014 it was done by the Border Patrol \\u2014 one of the greatest charts Ive ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. Thats pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \\\"Youve got to see this chart.\\\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But Im seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, thats the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, thats the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, its getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And were not going to do it. Were not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" We had a policy, \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \\\"You must give it to us. If you dont give it to us, there will be repercussions.\\\" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. Thats catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. Theres a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. Theyre coming from everywhere. Theyre coming at levels that weve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. Theyre coming from prisons. Theyre coming from jails. Theyre coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. Hed love to have you for dinner. Thats insane asylums. Theyre emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that weve never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because theyre taking their criminals and theyre putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but hes been getting great publicity because hes a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the countrys doing because their crime rate is down. And he said hes training all of these rough people. Theyre rough, rough, rough. Hes training them. And Ive been reading about this for two years. I think, \\\"Oh thats wonderful, lets take a look at it.\\\" But then I realize hes not training them; hes sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, hes sending them all to the United States. And hes different in that he doesnt say that. Hes trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesnt do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think were stupid. And they cant believe that theyre getting away with what theyre getting away with, but theyre not going to be getting away with it for long. Thats what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we wont be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because hes trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. Theyre down because theyre sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And youre seeing all the time. Thats why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation weve ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldnt believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyns heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachels mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. Ive also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people were talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. Hes a tough guy. The press doesnt like him because hes tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, whats happening, whats going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \\\"I dont want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\\\" But they said to him, \\\"Tell us, whats going wrong? Whats happening? What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Theres only one way youre going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\\\" True. He used a word I wouldnt use because I cant use that word. Because youd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \\\"He was a braggart.\\\" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said \\\"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\\\" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \\\"five years, sir, itll take five years, sir.\\\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. Its just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. \\\"How could you get along with him?\\\" Well, you know, its nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, youd say thats a wonderful thing. Now they say, \\\"How can you possibly do that?\\\" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. Hed like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. Were in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at whats happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. Hes running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really \\u2014 We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I dont think anybody has ever, what he did. Hes a real hero, a really great person. And hes running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. Were going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they werent doing things perfectly. So we said it doesnt kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didnt have one \\u2014 they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. Youve heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \\\"Why would you speak to him?\\\" I said, \\\"Because thats where the killing is.\\\" I dont have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: \\\"Dont ever do that. Dont ever do that again. Dont ever, ever do that again, youre going to stop.\\\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \\\"If you keep doing that, youre going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\\\" And he said, \\\"I understand, Your Excellency.\\\" He called me \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? Theyre selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, \\\"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\\\" I said, \\\"Youll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\\\" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. Its one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \\\"Whats Wrong With Our President?\\\". You dont even hear this. Youre not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They dont want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back \\u2014 and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I dont have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. Were going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and youre doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And theyre doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, \\\"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\\\" And the people at the shipyards said, \\\"This guy sort of knows what hes doing.\\\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but were going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are \\u2014 And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didnt have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we dont? No, no, were going to build an iron dome over our country, and were going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, Im going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. Its America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimers disease and many other diseases. Were going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I dont want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \\\"the 10 worst,\\\" I had to do it. I didnt want anybody to be confused. But this man said were going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. Were going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimers and so many other things. Were so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in womens sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nations once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nations capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things \\u2014 they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. Americas on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. Were going to take it, were going to make it a current \\u2014 I mean, were going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If were going to produce the new \\u2014 if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that were going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous \\u2014 literally, twice the electricity thats available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead were spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didnt work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If youre going to do this \\u2026 And by the way, Im all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, theyre going to be able to do it. And were going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. Its called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows Gods plan, or where lifes adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; hes an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \\\"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think its great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It wont make any difference. Please. Dont use any foul language.\\\" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \\\"It wont make any difference.\\\" Actually, it does, the storys not quite as good, but Ive been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. Ive got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. Hes a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies youve ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But hed get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklins been fantastic. And Im trying, Im just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. Im working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. Its your movement. Its the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It cant be stopped. It cant be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. Weve given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. Theyre not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And thats not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our countrys true potential \\u2014 and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. Its unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death \\u2014 and stared down those enemies \\u2014 to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many \\u2014 just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We cant forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful \\u2014 I think its so beautiful \\u2014 American flag. Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. Were going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down. To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win. Win, win, win, win, win, win. Nothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny \\u2014 and we will not fail. We will not fail. Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve. Americas future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before. And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\",\n          \"Fellow Democrats, fellow citizens: I thank you for the nomination youve offered me, and I especially thank you for choosing as my running mate the best partner any President ever had, Fritz Mondale. With gratitude and with determination I accept your nomination, and I am proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammered out at this convention. Fritz and I will mount a campaign that defines the real issues, a campaign that responds to the intelligence of the American people, a campaign that talks sense. And were going to beat the Republicans in November. Well win because we are the party of a great President who knew how to get reelected\\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And we are the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give em hell\\u2014Harry Truman. And as Truman said, he just told the truth and they thought it was hell. And were the party of a gallant man of spirit\\u2014John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And were the party of a great leader of compassion\\u2014Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the party of a great man who should have been President, who would have been one of the greatest Presidents in history\\u2014Hubert Horatio Hornblower\\u2014Humphrey. I have appreciated what this convention has said about Senator Humphrey, a great man who epitomized the spirit of the Democratic Party. And I would like to say that we are also the party of Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Edward Kennedy. Id like to say a personal word to Senator Kennedy. Ted, youre a tough competitor and a superb campaigner, and I can attest to that. Your speech before this convention was a magnificent statement of what the Democratic Party is and what it means to the people of this country and why a Democratic victory is so important this year. I reach out to you tonight, and I reach out to all those who supported you in your valiant and passionate campaign. Ted, your party needs and I need you. And I need your idealism and your dedication working for us. There is no doubt that even greater service lies ahead of you, and we are grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a larger cause to which your own life has been dedicated. I thank you for your support; well make great partners this fall in whipping the Republicans. We are Democrats and weve had our differences, but we share a bright vision of Americas future\\u2014a vision of a good life for all our people, a vision of a secure nation, a just society, a peaceful world, a strong America\\u2014confident and proud and united. And we have a memory of Franklin Roosevelt, 40 years ago, when he said that there are times in our history when concerns over our personal lives are overshadowed by our concern over \\\"what will happen to the county we have known.\\\" This is such a time, and I can tell you that the choice to be made this year can transform our own personal lives and the life of our country as well. During the last Presidential campaign, I crisscrossed this country and I listened to thousands and thousands of people-housewives and farmers, teachers and small business leaders, workers and students, the elderly and the poor, people of every race and every background and every walk of life. It was a powerful experience\\u2014a total immersion in the human reality of America. And I have now had another kind of total immersion\\u2014being President of the United States of America. Let me talk for a moment about what that job is like and what Ive learned from it. Ive learned that only the most complex and difficult task comes before me in the Oval Office. No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there. Ive learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. Im wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago. And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans. The poor and the jobless and the afflicted-theyve become part of me. My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. The life of every human being on Earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the Oval Office. The Presidents power for building and his power for destruction are awesome. And the powers greatest exactly where the stakes are highest\\u2014in matters of war and peace. And Ive learned something else, something that I have come to see with extraordinary clarity: Above all, I must look ahead, because the President of the United States is the steward of the Nations destiny. He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory. And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And thats why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. Thats why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort. The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. Thats why the election of 1980 is so important. Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but its more than that\\u2014its a choice between two futures. The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight. The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace. I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone. I see a future of justice\\u2014the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America. And I see a future of peace\\u2014a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well. That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. Its the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose. But there is another possible future. In that other future I see despair\\u2014despair of millions who would struggle for equal opportunity and a better life and struggle alone. And I see surrender\\u2014the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk\\u2014the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race. No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party. The consequences of those commitments and policies would drive us down the wrong road. Its up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny. The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present. But while we Democrats grapple with the real challenges of a real world, others talk about a world of tinsel and make-believe. Lets look for a moment at their make-believe world. In their fantasy America, inner-city people and farm workers and laborers do not exist. Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions\\u2014simple and wrong. Its a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions\\u2014it sounds too good to be true, and it is. The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Lets take a hard look at the consequences of our choice. You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength\\u2014steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third. Weve reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since Ive been President weve had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force\\u2014all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms. The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers. The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass. Its simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia\\u2014the Moscow Olympics. The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldnt go along with that. He doesnt seem to know what to do with the Russians. Hes not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them. As I look back at my first term, Im grateful that weve had a country for the full 4 years of peace. And thats what were going to have for the next 4 years-peace. Its only common sense that if America is to stay secure and at peace, we must encourage others to be peaceful as well. As you know, weve helped in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia where weve stood firm for racial justice and democracy. And we have also helped in the Middle East. Some have criticized the Camp David accords and theyve criticized some delays in the implementation of the Middle East peace treaty. Well, before I became President there was no Camp David accords and there was no Middle East peace treaty. Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Now thats the kind of future were offering\\u2014of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall. I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights. Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think its naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for? Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II. Ask those who are suffering for the sake of justice and liberty around the world. Ask the millions whove fled tyranny if America should stop speaking out for human principles. Ask the American people. I tell you that as long as I am President, we will hold high the banner of human rights, and you can depend on it. Here at home the choice between the two futures is equally important. In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies. We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress. Now, after 3 years of struggle, we have that program. The battle to secure Americas energy future has been fully and finally joined. Americans have cooperated with dramatic results. Weve reversed decades of dangerous and growing dependence on foreign oil. We are now importing 20 percent less oil\\u2014that is 1 1/2 million barrels of oil every day less than the day I took office. And with our new energy policy now in place, we can discover more, produce more, create more, and conserve more energy, and we will use American resources, American technology, and millions of American workers to do it with. Now, what do the Republicans propose? Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that weve done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with. Thats one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to \\\"unleash\\\" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. Thats it. That is it. Thats their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No ! THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and well begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November. When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and weve met them all head-on. Weve slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and were now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. Weve increased our exports dramatically. Weve reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs\\u2014the biggest increase in the history of our country. But the road is bumpy, and last years skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, were struggling to bring inflation under control. We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, weve laid the groundwork for a new economic age. Our economic renewal program for the 1980s will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. Itll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals\\u2014lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs. Its time to put all America back to work\\u2014but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things well rebuild together and build together:\\u2014new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;\\u2014a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;\\u2014industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;\\u2014job training for workers displaced by economic changes;\\u2014new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;\\u2014better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;\\u2014and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy. This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen. We are talking about the United States of America, and those who count this country out as an economic superpower are going to find out just how wrong they are. Were going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980s a time of growth for America. The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us. Their partys own Vice Presidential nominee said that Reagan-Kemp-Roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. He called it \\\"voodoo economics\\\". He suddenly changed his mind toward the end of the Republican Convention, but he was right the first time. Along with this gigantic tax cut, the new Republican leaders promise to protect retirement and health programs and to have massive increases in defense spending-and they claim they can balance the budget. If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial\\u2014and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose. But the American people will not stand for it. The Democratic Party has always embodied the hope of our people for justice, opportunity, and a better life, and weve worked in every way possible to strengthen the American family, to encourage self-reliance, and to follow the Old Testament admonition: \\\"Defend the poor and the fatherless; give justice to the afflicted and needy.\\\" Weve struggled to assure that no child in America ever goes to bed hungry, that no elderly couple in America has to live in a substandard home, and that no young person in America is excluded from college because the family is poor. But what have the Republicans proposed?\\u2014just an attack on everything that weve done in the achievement of social justice and decency that weve won in the last 50 years, ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelts first term. They would make social security voluntary. They would reverse our progress on the minimum wage, full employment laws, safety in the work place, and a healthy environment. Lately, as you know, the Republicans have been quoting Democratic Presidents. But who can blame them? Would you rather quote Herbert Hoover or Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Would you rather quote Richard Nixon or John Fitzgerald Kennedy? The Republicans have always been the party of privilege, but this year their leaders have gone even further. In their platform, they have repudiated the best traditions of their own party. Where is the conscience of Lincoln in the party of Lincoln? Whats become of their traditional Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility? Whats happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control? Now, I dont claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I dont claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, theyve not all been easy. But I will say this: Weve been tested under fire. Weve neither ducked nor hidden, and weve tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. Weve made tough decisions, and weve taken the heat for them. Weve made mistakes, and weve learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future. Weve done something else, perhaps even more important. In good times and bad, in the valleys and on the peaks, weve told people the truth, the hard truth, the truth that sometimes hurts. One truth that we Americans have learned is that our dream has been earned for progress and for peace. Look what our land has been through within our own memory\\u2014a great depression, a world war, a technological explosion, the civil rights revolution, the bitterness of Vietnam, the shame of Watergate, the twilight peace of nuclear terror. Through each of these momentous experiences weve learned the hard way about the world and about ourselves. But weve matured and weve grown as a nation and weve grown stronger. Weve learned the uses and the limitations of power. Weve learned the beauty and responsibility of freedom. Weve learned the value and the obligation of justice. And we have learned the necessity of peace. Some would argue that to master these lessons is somehow to limit our potential. That is not so. A nation which knows its true strengths, which sees its true challenges, which understands legitimate constraints, that nation\\u2014our nation\\u2014is far stronger than one which takes refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Democratic Party\\u2014the American people-have understood these fundamental truths. All of us can sympathize with the desire for easy answers. Theres often the temptation to substitute idle dreams for hard reality. The new Republican leaders are hoping that our Nation will succumb to that temptation this year, but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the American people. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill came to North America and he said, \\\"We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\\\" We Americans have courage. Americans have always been on the cutting edge of change. Weve always looked forward with anticipation and confidence. I still want the same thing that all of you want\\u2014a self-reliant neighborhood, strong families, work for the able-bodied and good medical care for the sick, opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old, equal rights and justice for all people. I want teachers eager to explain what a civilization really is, and I want students to understand their own needs and their own aims, but also the needs and yearnings of their neighbors. I want women free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves. I want our farmers growing crops to feed our Nation and the world, secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of us. I want workers to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country. And I want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new ideas. And I want minority citizens fully to join the mainstream of American life. And I want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our Nation, and Im determined to do it. I need for all of you to join me in fulfilling that vision. The choice, the choice between the two futures, could not be more clear. If we succumb to a dream world then well wake up to a nightmare. But if we start with reality and fight to make our dreams a reality, then Americans will have a good life, a life of meaning and purpose in a nation thats strong and secure. Above all, I want us to be what the Founders of our Nation meant us to become\\u2014the land of freedom, the land of peace, and the land of hope.

[Applause.] Thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. [Applause.] Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. [Applause.] Okay, lets get to business. Lets get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but Im no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know shes looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They \\u2014 they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin \\u2014 [applause]; and wherever our parents jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music \\u2014 Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, \\\"Stay close.\\\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \\\"Run, Kamala, run. Dont be afraid. Dont let anything stop you.\\\" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess \\u2014 and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated \\u2014 with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child \\u2014 as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for womens health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us \\u2014 and she always \\u2014 she also taught us \\u2014 and she also taught us \\\"and never do anything half-assed.\\\" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- \\u2014 Constance Baker Motley \\u2014 those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didnt want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor \\u2014 to protect people like Wanda \\u2014 because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: \\\"Kamala Harris, for the people.\\\" [Applause.] And to be clear \\u2014 and to be clear, my entire career, Ive only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with \\u2014 people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election \\u2014 and \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 and with this election, our nation \\u2014 our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 not \\u2014 not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred Americas fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my lifes work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And thats the fight we are in right now: a fight for Americas future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences \\u2014 but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider \\u2014 consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and separately \\u2014 and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider \\u2014 consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider \\u2014 consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know \\u2014 and we know what a second Trump term would look like. Its all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: \\u2014 we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting \\u2014 and we are charting a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to Americas success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And Ill tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. Thats why we will create what I call an opportunity economy \\u2014 an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end Americas housing shortage \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Not \\u2014 he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: \\u2014 up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax \\u2014 call it a \\\"Trump tax\\\" \\u2014 that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And lets be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \\\"I did it, and Im proud to have done it.\\\" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, Ill tell you, over the past two years, Ive traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is whats happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on womens miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask \\u2014 one must ask: Why exactly is it that they dont trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride \\u2014 [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis \\u2014 [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know \\u2014 I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, \\\"do whatever the hell they want.\\\" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russias plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response \\u2014 over 50 countries \\u2014 to defend against Putins aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israels right to defend itself \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump \\u2014 who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know \\u2014 they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump wont hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of Americas security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans \\u2014 fellow Americans, I \\u2014 I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go \\u2014 everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world \\u2014 that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us \\u2014 none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth \\u2014 the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.] So, lets get out there, lets fight for it. Lets get out there, lets vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.] Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]\",\n          \"Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \\\"Bob.\\\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. Were going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \\\"Tell us what happened, please.\\\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and youll never hear it from me a second time, because its actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which Im very lucky I didnt do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \\\"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\\\" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didnt move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isnt the reason that they didnt move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And theres an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, \\\"Why is there so much blood?\\\" He said, \\\"Its the ears, they bleed more.\\\" So we learned something. But they just \\u2014 They just, this beautiful crowd, they didnt want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didnt want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. Theyre incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassins life. Took him out. Im not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants \\\"Yes, you are.\\\"] Thank you. But Im not. And Ill tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didnt know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \\\"Fight, fight, fight.\\\" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, youve all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. Were never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and theyre going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days weve raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just \\u2014 called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \\\"Well, Im going to be sending a lot of money, but it cant compensate.\\\" They all said the same thing: \\\"Youre right, sir; we appreciate so much what youre doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\\\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now theyre doing very well. Theyre going to be OK. Theyre going to be doing very well. Theyre warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, \\\"We love Trump.\\\"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. Were going to turn our nation around and were going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens \\u2014 we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is whats been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity \\u2014 thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which Ive been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. Were going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldnt it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so \\u2026 I also want to thank my entire family \\u2014 Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasnt he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation hes had in about \\u2014 maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife \\u2014 very far away. I wont tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, \\\"Yeah, I wont be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I cant do it.\\\" And they came and they said, \\\"Dana wont be able to do it.\\\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \\\"Well, you know, thats too bad.\\\" But I understand, hes away and its good. Its good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \\\"Sir, Dana just called; hes going to do it.\\\" And his wife, she said, \\\"You cant turn him down. You just cant do it. You have to go.\\\" Thats a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now hes going to get on the plane in a little while and hes going to go back home to his wife. But theyre great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because thats not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \\\"I want to be a part of it.\\\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, hes amazing. Everyone loves him. I didnt even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think hes making so much money he doesnt know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and Ive known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. Thats Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. Hes a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called \\u2026 And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There arent a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by \\u2026 Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didnt want to really come up here. But he was so great. And hes such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. Theyve got to stop that because theyre destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, wed have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, hes good. I like his wife even better, by the way. Shes here. Thank you, Jason. But Im thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. Hes going to be a great vice president, hes going to be great. Hell be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \\\"Were going to try and stop MAGA.\\\" MAGA is \\\"Make America Great Again.\\\" What are you going to stop? Theres nothing to stop. Then they say, \\\"Oh, thats right.\\\" Its very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but hes going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., youre going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of \\u2014 oh, there they are. There they are, thats \\u2014 You are so easy to spot. And Green Bays going to have a good team this year, right? Theyre going to have a good team. Theyre going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesnt like it, but its true. Youre going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic \\u2026 development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. Ill be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. Were going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether youre a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobodys ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. Weve got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebodys terminally ill. And hopefully theres nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. Theyre terminally ill and they cant use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you cant do it. Theyve been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasnt that easy. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. They didnt want the risk. The labs didnt want to do it because if it didnt work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office \\u2014 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but its not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying \\u2014 just die \\u2014 we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where theyre not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. Theyre going to get it really fast, and whats happened is were saving thousands and thousands of lives. Its incredible. Right to Try. Its \\u2026 great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. Theyve never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and its taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. Its a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe whats happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. Its time for a change. This administration cant come close to solving the problems. Were dealing with very tough, very fierce people. Theyre fierce people. And we dont have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then theyre fierce. Then theyre fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what theyre doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy\\u2026 Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobodys ever seen before, and well end lots of different things. Well start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. Well do it more. Now, people dont realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. Well do it again, but well do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which Ive already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \\\"Oh, thats OK. We wont go to Congress.\\\" I call it an \\\"invasion.\\\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \\\"Im going to take a little of that money, because this is an invasion.\\\" And we built \\u2014 Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because whats more, whats better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country thats killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Were not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called \\\"Deface the Nation,\\\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \\\"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\\\" And they said to me, Well, I think thats about it. They werent going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that well never let happen again. The election result. Were never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. Were never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. Im not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that hes done to this country is unthinkable. Its unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and were going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. Its all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, were going \\u2014 Nobodys \\u2014 Nobody can believe it. You cant believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what youre making, it doesnt matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest theyve ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. Theyre not putting away anything. Theyre barely living. Theyre going into saving accounts. Theyre taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, its called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country thats suffered great inflation. Weve suffered the worst inflation weve ever had. But go back and see whats happened to those countries. Weve had the worst inflation weve ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. Its been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know whos taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know whos being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because theyre taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And theyre also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. Thats what it is. Its despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. Were going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed \\u2014 and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether youve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. Thats what were going to do. You dont even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. Theyre all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that theyve ever seen. Every single one. And its true. Its true. And theres love in the room. Theres great love in the room. So Id better finish strong. Otherwise, well blow it, and we cant let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, theres not one that I can think of where I said, \\\"Oh, gee, that wasnt great.\\\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Dont do that to me. Theyre already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was \\u2014 I think were actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a \\u2014 First of all, look at these crowds. Youd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, its about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for Americas renewal. And you saw that agenda, and its very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after theyre done. In their case, fortunately they dont read them because theyre pretty bad. Its a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. Were talking about just months. It cant come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. Its not affordable. People cant live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesnt matter what they are because you cant get the money anyway. Cant buy houses. Young people cant get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesnt. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. Id watch the \\u2014 and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? Thats all they talked about. This is the only administration that said were going to raise your taxes by four times what youre paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? Ive never heard it. Youre paying too much, were going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. Were going to give you more and its going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. Thats whats going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. Theyve spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. Its a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and theyre being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because were going to bring back car manufacturing and were going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. Were going to make them. We dont mind the \\u2014 We dont mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they dont agree with us, well put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. Theyve taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And were really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I dont even talk about it because of Covid. I dont even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years theyve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. Were going to get them all back. Were going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here its very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, Im staying in a nice one. Its called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where were leading by about 14 points. Hello. Ill see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And its a great building and the waitress comes over. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" Really nice person. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" \\\"Oh sir, its so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\\\" And she said, \\\"Actually,\\\" and I didnt know this, very little cash is given. Its all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money its just ridiculous. And they dont believe anything we say. Theyve just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, \\\"This shows the level of\\u2014\\\" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, \\\"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\\\" She said, \\\"What a great idea.\\\" I got my information from a very smart waitress. Thats better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. Its a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, theyre coming in. Theyre going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and youre not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and were going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst thats ever been seen anywhere in the world. Theres never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, hes incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they dont have to do anything but they want to. Theyre patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And theyre very tough people. But they dont want to do this job. Theyll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. Theyre the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries werent accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that were not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldnt take all the calls. \\\"Sir, sir, whats the problem?\\\" I said, \\\"You wont take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You wont take them back.\\\" \\\"Well sir, if youd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\\\" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldnt accept them. Theyd put planes on the runway so you couldnt land the plane. Theyd close the roads so you couldnt take the buses; theyd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \\\"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. Well take them back.\\\" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And were going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \\\"Look at, Im so proud of it.\\\" I think its one of the greatest \\u2014 it was done by the Border Patrol \\u2014 one of the greatest charts Ive ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. Thats pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \\\"Youve got to see this chart.\\\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But Im seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, thats the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, thats the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, its getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And were not going to do it. Were not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" We had a policy, \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \\\"You must give it to us. If you dont give it to us, there will be repercussions.\\\" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. Thats catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. Theres a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. Theyre coming from everywhere. Theyre coming at levels that weve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. Theyre coming from prisons. Theyre coming from jails. Theyre coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. Hed love to have you for dinner. Thats insane asylums. Theyre emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that weve never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because theyre taking their criminals and theyre putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but hes been getting great publicity because hes a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the countrys doing because their crime rate is down. And he said hes training all of these rough people. Theyre rough, rough, rough. Hes training them. And Ive been reading about this for two years. I think, \\\"Oh thats wonderful, lets take a look at it.\\\" But then I realize hes not training them; hes sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, hes sending them all to the United States. And hes different in that he doesnt say that. Hes trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesnt do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think were stupid. And they cant believe that theyre getting away with what theyre getting away with, but theyre not going to be getting away with it for long. Thats what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we wont be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because hes trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. Theyre down because theyre sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And youre seeing all the time. Thats why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation weve ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldnt believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyns heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachels mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. Ive also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people were talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. Hes a tough guy. The press doesnt like him because hes tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, whats happening, whats going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \\\"I dont want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\\\" But they said to him, \\\"Tell us, whats going wrong? Whats happening? What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Theres only one way youre going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\\\" True. He used a word I wouldnt use because I cant use that word. Because youd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \\\"He was a braggart.\\\" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said \\\"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\\\" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \\\"five years, sir, itll take five years, sir.\\\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. Its just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. \\\"How could you get along with him?\\\" Well, you know, its nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, youd say thats a wonderful thing. Now they say, \\\"How can you possibly do that?\\\" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. Hed like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. Were in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at whats happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. Hes running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really \\u2014 We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I dont think anybody has ever, what he did. Hes a real hero, a really great person. And hes running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. Were going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they werent doing things perfectly. So we said it doesnt kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didnt have one \\u2014 they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. Youve heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \\\"Why would you speak to him?\\\" I said, \\\"Because thats where the killing is.\\\" I dont have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: \\\"Dont ever do that. Dont ever do that again. Dont ever, ever do that again, youre going to stop.\\\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \\\"If you keep doing that, youre going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\\\" And he said, \\\"I understand, Your Excellency.\\\" He called me \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? Theyre selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, \\\"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\\\" I said, \\\"Youll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\\\" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. Its one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \\\"Whats Wrong With Our President?\\\". You dont even hear this. Youre not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They dont want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back \\u2014 and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I dont have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. Were going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and youre doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And theyre doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, \\\"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\\\" And the people at the shipyards said, \\\"This guy sort of knows what hes doing.\\\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but were going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are \\u2014 And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didnt have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we dont? No, no, were going to build an iron dome over our country, and were going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, Im going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. Its America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimers disease and many other diseases. Were going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I dont want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \\\"the 10 worst,\\\" I had to do it. I didnt want anybody to be confused. But this man said were going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. Were going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimers and so many other things. Were so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in womens sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nations once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nations capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things \\u2014 they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. Americas on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. Were going to take it, were going to make it a current \\u2014 I mean, were going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If were going to produce the new \\u2014 if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that were going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous \\u2014 literally, twice the electricity thats available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead were spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didnt work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If youre going to do this \\u2026 And by the way, Im all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, theyre going to be able to do it. And were going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. Its called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows Gods plan, or where lifes adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; hes an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \\\"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think its great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It wont make any difference. Please. Dont use any foul language.\\\" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \\\"It wont make any difference.\\\" Actually, it does, the storys not quite as good, but Ive been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. Ive got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. Hes a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies youve ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But hed get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklins been fantastic. And Im trying, Im just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. Im working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. Its your movement. Its the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It cant be stopped. It cant be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. Weve given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. Theyre not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And thats not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our countrys true potential \\u2014 and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. Its unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death \\u2014 and stared down those enemies \\u2014 to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many \\u2014 just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We cant forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful \\u2014 I think its so beautiful \\u2014 American flag. Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. Were going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down. To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win. Win, win, win, win, win, win. Nothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny \\u2014 and we will not fail. We will not fail. Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve. Americas future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before. And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\",\n          \"Fellow Democrats, fellow citizens: I thank you for the nomination youve offered me, and I especially thank you for choosing as my running mate the best partner any President ever had, Fritz Mondale. With gratitude and with determination I accept your nomination, and I am proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammered out at this convention. Fritz and I will mount a campaign that defines the real issues, a campaign that responds to the intelligence of the American people, a campaign that talks sense. And were going to beat the Republicans in November. Well win because we are the party of a great President who knew how to get reelected\\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And we are the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give em hell\\u2014Harry Truman. And as Truman said, he just told the truth and they thought it was hell. And were the party of a gallant man of spirit\\u2014John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And were the party of a great leader of compassion\\u2014Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the party of a great man who should have been President, who would have been one of the greatest Presidents in history\\u2014Hubert Horatio Hornblower\\u2014Humphrey. I have appreciated what this convention has said about Senator Humphrey, a great man who epitomized the spirit of the Democratic Party. And I would like to say that we are also the party of Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Edward Kennedy. Id like to say a personal word to Senator Kennedy. Ted, youre a tough competitor and a superb campaigner, and I can attest to that. Your speech before this convention was a magnificent statement of what the Democratic Party is and what it means to the people of this country and why a Democratic victory is so important this year. I reach out to you tonight, and I reach out to all those who supported you in your valiant and passionate campaign. Ted, your party needs and I need you. And I need your idealism and your dedication working for us. There is no doubt that even greater service lies ahead of you, and we are grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a larger cause to which your own life has been dedicated. I thank you for your support; well make great partners this fall in whipping the Republicans. We are Democrats and weve had our differences, but we share a bright vision of Americas future\\u2014a vision of a good life for all our people, a vision of a secure nation, a just society, a peaceful world, a strong America\\u2014confident and proud and united. And we have a memory of Franklin Roosevelt, 40 years ago, when he said that there are times in our history when concerns over our personal lives are overshadowed by our concern over \\\"what will happen to the county we have known.\\\" This is such a time, and I can tell you that the choice to be made this year can transform our own personal lives and the life of our country as well. During the last Presidential campaign, I crisscrossed this country and I listened to thousands and thousands of people-housewives and farmers, teachers and small business leaders, workers and students, the elderly and the poor, people of every race and every background and every walk of life. It was a powerful experience\\u2014a total immersion in the human reality of America. And I have now had another kind of total immersion\\u2014being President of the United States of America. Let me talk for a moment about what that job is like and what Ive learned from it. Ive learned that only the most complex and difficult task comes before me in the Oval Office. No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there. Ive learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. Im wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago. And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans. The poor and the jobless and the afflicted-theyve become part of me. My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. The life of every human being on Earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the Oval Office. The Presidents power for building and his power for destruction are awesome. And the powers greatest exactly where the stakes are highest\\u2014in matters of war and peace. And Ive learned something else, something that I have come to see with extraordinary clarity: Above all, I must look ahead, because the President of the United States is the steward of the Nations destiny. He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory. And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And thats why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. Thats why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort. The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. Thats why the election of 1980 is so important. Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but its more than that\\u2014its a choice between two futures. The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight. The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace. I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone. I see a future of justice\\u2014the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America. And I see a future of peace\\u2014a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well. That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. Its the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose. But there is another possible future. In that other future I see despair\\u2014despair of millions who would struggle for equal opportunity and a better life and struggle alone. And I see surrender\\u2014the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk\\u2014the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race. No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party. The consequences of those commitments and policies would drive us down the wrong road. Its up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny. The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present. But while we Democrats grapple with the real challenges of a real world, others talk about a world of tinsel and make-believe. Lets look for a moment at their make-believe world. In their fantasy America, inner-city people and farm workers and laborers do not exist. Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions\\u2014simple and wrong. Its a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions\\u2014it sounds too good to be true, and it is. The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Lets take a hard look at the consequences of our choice. You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength\\u2014steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third. Weve reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since Ive been President weve had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force\\u2014all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms. The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers. The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass. Its simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia\\u2014the Moscow Olympics. The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldnt go along with that. He doesnt seem to know what to do with the Russians. Hes not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them. As I look back at my first term, Im grateful that weve had a country for the full 4 years of peace. And thats what were going to have for the next 4 years-peace. Its only common sense that if America is to stay secure and at peace, we must encourage others to be peaceful as well. As you know, weve helped in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia where weve stood firm for racial justice and democracy. And we have also helped in the Middle East. Some have criticized the Camp David accords and theyve criticized some delays in the implementation of the Middle East peace treaty. Well, before I became President there was no Camp David accords and there was no Middle East peace treaty. Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Now thats the kind of future were offering\\u2014of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall. I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights. Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think its naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for? Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II. Ask those who are suffering for the sake of justice and liberty around the world. Ask the millions whove fled tyranny if America should stop speaking out for human principles. Ask the American people. I tell you that as long as I am President, we will hold high the banner of human rights, and you can depend on it. Here at home the choice between the two futures is equally important. In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies. We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress. Now, after 3 years of struggle, we have that program. The battle to secure Americas energy future has been fully and finally joined. Americans have cooperated with dramatic results. Weve reversed decades of dangerous and growing dependence on foreign oil. We are now importing 20 percent less oil\\u2014that is 1 1/2 million barrels of oil every day less than the day I took office. And with our new energy policy now in place, we can discover more, produce more, create more, and conserve more energy, and we will use American resources, American technology, and millions of American workers to do it with. Now, what do the Republicans propose? Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that weve done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with. Thats one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to \\\"unleash\\\" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. Thats it. That is it. Thats their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No ! THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and well begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November. When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and weve met them all head-on. Weve slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and were now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. Weve increased our exports dramatically. Weve reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs\\u2014the biggest increase in the history of our country. But the road is bumpy, and last years skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, were struggling to bring inflation under control. We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, weve laid the groundwork for a new economic age. Our economic renewal program for the 1980s will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. Itll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals\\u2014lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs. Its time to put all America back to work\\u2014but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things well rebuild together and build together:\\u2014new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;\\u2014a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;\\u2014industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;\\u2014job training for workers displaced by economic changes;\\u2014new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;\\u2014better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;\\u2014and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy. This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen. We are talking about the United States of America, and those who count this country out as an economic superpower are going to find out just how wrong they are. Were going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980s a time of growth for America. The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us. Their partys own Vice Presidential nominee said that Reagan-Kemp-Roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. He called it \\\"voodoo economics\\\". He suddenly changed his mind toward the end of the Republican Convention, but he was right the first time. Along with this gigantic tax cut, the new Republican leaders promise to protect retirement and health programs and to have massive increases in defense spending-and they claim they can balance the budget. If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial\\u2014and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose. But the American people will not stand for it. The Democratic Party has always embodied the hope of our people for justice, opportunity, and a better life, and weve worked in every way possible to strengthen the American family, to encourage self-reliance, and to follow the Old Testament admonition: \\\"Defend the poor and the fatherless; give justice to the afflicted and needy.\\\" Weve struggled to assure that no child in America ever goes to bed hungry, that no elderly couple in America has to live in a substandard home, and that no young person in America is excluded from college because the family is poor. But what have the Republicans proposed?\\u2014just an attack on everything that weve done in the achievement of social justice and decency that weve won in the last 50 years, ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelts first term. They would make social security voluntary. They would reverse our progress on the minimum wage, full employment laws, safety in the work place, and a healthy environment. Lately, as you know, the Republicans have been quoting Democratic Presidents. But who can blame them? Would you rather quote Herbert Hoover or Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Would you rather quote Richard Nixon or John Fitzgerald Kennedy? The Republicans have always been the party of privilege, but this year their leaders have gone even further. In their platform, they have repudiated the best traditions of their own party. Where is the conscience of Lincoln in the party of Lincoln? Whats become of their traditional Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility? Whats happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control? Now, I dont claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I dont claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, theyve not all been easy. But I will say this: Weve been tested under fire. Weve neither ducked nor hidden, and weve tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. Weve made tough decisions, and weve taken the heat for them. Weve made mistakes, and weve learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future. Weve done something else, perhaps even more important. In good times and bad, in the valleys and on the peaks, weve told people the truth, the hard truth, the truth that sometimes hurts. One truth that we Americans have learned is that our dream has been earned for progress and for peace. Look what our land has been through within our own memory\\u2014a great depression, a world war, a technological explosion, the civil rights revolution, the bitterness of Vietnam, the shame of Watergate, the twilight peace of nuclear terror. Through each of these momentous experiences weve learned the hard way about the world and about ourselves. But weve matured and weve grown as a nation and weve grown stronger. Weve learned the uses and the limitations of power. Weve learned the beauty and responsibility of freedom. Weve learned the value and the obligation of justice. And we have learned the necessity of peace. Some would argue that to master these lessons is somehow to limit our potential. That is not so. A nation which knows its true strengths, which sees its true challenges, which understands legitimate constraints, that nation\\u2014our nation\\u2014is far stronger than one which takes refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Democratic Party\\u2014the American people-have understood these fundamental truths. All of us can sympathize with the desire for easy answers. Theres often the temptation to substitute idle dreams for hard reality. The new Republican leaders are hoping that our Nation will succumb to that temptation this year, but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the American people. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill came to North America and he said, \\\"We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\\\" We Americans have courage. Americans have always been on the cutting edge of change. Weve always looked forward with anticipation and confidence. I still want the same thing that all of you want\\u2014a self-reliant neighborhood, strong families, work for the able-bodied and good medical care for the sick, opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old, equal rights and justice for all people. I want teachers eager to explain what a civilization really is, and I want students to understand their own needs and their own aims, but also the needs and yearnings of their neighbors. I want women free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves. I want our farmers growing crops to feed our Nation and the world, secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of us. I want workers to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country. And I want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new ideas. And I want minority citizens fully to join the mainstream of American life. And I want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our Nation, and Im determined to do it. I need for all of you to join me in fulfilling that vision. The choice, the choice between the two futures, could not be more clear. If we succumb to a dream world then well wake up to a nightmare. But if we start with reality and fight to make our dreams a reality, then Americans will have a good life, a life of meaning and purpose in a nation thats strong and secure. Above all, I want us to be what the Founders of our Nation meant us to become\\u2014the land of freedom, the land of peace, and the land of hope.

[Applause.] Thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. [Applause.] Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. [Applause.] Okay, lets get to business. Lets get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but Im no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know shes looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They \\u2014 they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin \\u2014 [applause]; and wherever our parents jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music \\u2014 Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, \\\"Stay close.\\\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \\\"Run, Kamala, run. Dont be afraid. Dont let anything stop you.\\\" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess \\u2014 and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated \\u2014 with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child \\u2014 as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for womens health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us \\u2014 and she always \\u2014 she also taught us \\u2014 and she also taught us \\\"and never do anything half-assed.\\\" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- \\u2014 Constance Baker Motley \\u2014 those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didnt want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor \\u2014 to protect people like Wanda \\u2014 because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: \\\"Kamala Harris, for the people.\\\" [Applause.] And to be clear \\u2014 and to be clear, my entire career, Ive only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with \\u2014 people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election \\u2014 and \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 and with this election, our nation \\u2014 our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 not \\u2014 not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred Americas fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my lifes work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And thats the fight we are in right now: a fight for Americas future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences \\u2014 but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider \\u2014 consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and separately \\u2014 and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider \\u2014 consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider \\u2014 consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know \\u2014 and we know what a second Trump term would look like. Its all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: \\u2014 we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting \\u2014 and we are charting a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to Americas success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And Ill tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. Thats why we will create what I call an opportunity economy \\u2014 an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end Americas housing shortage \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Not \\u2014 he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: \\u2014 up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax \\u2014 call it a \\\"Trump tax\\\" \\u2014 that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And lets be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \\\"I did it, and Im proud to have done it.\\\" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, Ill tell you, over the past two years, Ive traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is whats happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on womens miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask \\u2014 one must ask: Why exactly is it that they dont trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride \\u2014 [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis \\u2014 [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know \\u2014 I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, \\\"do whatever the hell they want.\\\" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russias plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response \\u2014 over 50 countries \\u2014 to defend against Putins aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israels right to defend itself \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump \\u2014 who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know \\u2014 they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump wont hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of Americas security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans \\u2014 fellow Americans, I \\u2014 I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go \\u2014 everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world \\u2014 that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us \\u2014 none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth \\u2014 the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.] So, lets get out there, lets fight for it. Lets get out there, lets vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.] Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]\",\n          \"Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \\\"Bob.\\\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. Were going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \\\"Tell us what happened, please.\\\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and youll never hear it from me a second time, because its actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which Im very lucky I didnt do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \\\"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\\\" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didnt move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isnt the reason that they didnt move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And theres an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, \\\"Why is there so much blood?\\\" He said, \\\"Its the ears, they bleed more.\\\" So we learned something. But they just \\u2014 They just, this beautiful crowd, they didnt want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didnt want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. Theyre incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassins life. Took him out. Im not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants \\\"Yes, you are.\\\"] Thank you. But Im not. And Ill tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didnt know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \\\"Fight, fight, fight.\\\" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, youve all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. Were never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and theyre going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days weve raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just \\u2014 called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \\\"Well, Im going to be sending a lot of money, but it cant compensate.\\\" They all said the same thing: \\\"Youre right, sir; we appreciate so much what youre doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\\\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now theyre doing very well. Theyre going to be OK. Theyre going to be doing very well. Theyre warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, \\\"We love Trump.\\\"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. Were going to turn our nation around and were going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens \\u2014 we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is whats been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity \\u2014 thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which Ive been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. Were going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldnt it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so \\u2026 I also want to thank my entire family \\u2014 Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasnt he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation hes had in about \\u2014 maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife \\u2014 very far away. I wont tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, \\\"Yeah, I wont be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I cant do it.\\\" And they came and they said, \\\"Dana wont be able to do it.\\\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \\\"Well, you know, thats too bad.\\\" But I understand, hes away and its good. Its good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \\\"Sir, Dana just called; hes going to do it.\\\" And his wife, she said, \\\"You cant turn him down. You just cant do it. You have to go.\\\" Thats a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now hes going to get on the plane in a little while and hes going to go back home to his wife. But theyre great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because thats not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \\\"I want to be a part of it.\\\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, hes amazing. Everyone loves him. I didnt even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think hes making so much money he doesnt know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and Ive known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. Thats Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. Hes a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called \\u2026 And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There arent a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by \\u2026 Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didnt want to really come up here. But he was so great. And hes such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. Theyve got to stop that because theyre destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, wed have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, hes good. I like his wife even better, by the way. Shes here. Thank you, Jason. But Im thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. Hes going to be a great vice president, hes going to be great. Hell be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \\\"Were going to try and stop MAGA.\\\" MAGA is \\\"Make America Great Again.\\\" What are you going to stop? Theres nothing to stop. Then they say, \\\"Oh, thats right.\\\" Its very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but hes going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., youre going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of \\u2014 oh, there they are. There they are, thats \\u2014 You are so easy to spot. And Green Bays going to have a good team this year, right? Theyre going to have a good team. Theyre going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesnt like it, but its true. Youre going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic \\u2026 development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. Ill be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. Were going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether youre a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobodys ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. Weve got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebodys terminally ill. And hopefully theres nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. Theyre terminally ill and they cant use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you cant do it. Theyve been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasnt that easy. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. They didnt want the risk. The labs didnt want to do it because if it didnt work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office \\u2014 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but its not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying \\u2014 just die \\u2014 we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where theyre not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. Theyre going to get it really fast, and whats happened is were saving thousands and thousands of lives. Its incredible. Right to Try. Its \\u2026 great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. Theyve never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and its taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. Its a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe whats happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. Its time for a change. This administration cant come close to solving the problems. Were dealing with very tough, very fierce people. Theyre fierce people. And we dont have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then theyre fierce. Then theyre fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what theyre doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy\\u2026 Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobodys ever seen before, and well end lots of different things. Well start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. Well do it more. Now, people dont realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. Well do it again, but well do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which Ive already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \\\"Oh, thats OK. We wont go to Congress.\\\" I call it an \\\"invasion.\\\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \\\"Im going to take a little of that money, because this is an invasion.\\\" And we built \\u2014 Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because whats more, whats better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country thats killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Were not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called \\\"Deface the Nation,\\\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \\\"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\\\" And they said to me, Well, I think thats about it. They werent going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that well never let happen again. The election result. Were never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. Were never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. Im not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that hes done to this country is unthinkable. Its unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and were going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. Its all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, were going \\u2014 Nobodys \\u2014 Nobody can believe it. You cant believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what youre making, it doesnt matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest theyve ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. Theyre not putting away anything. Theyre barely living. Theyre going into saving accounts. Theyre taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, its called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country thats suffered great inflation. Weve suffered the worst inflation weve ever had. But go back and see whats happened to those countries. Weve had the worst inflation weve ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. Its been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know whos taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know whos being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because theyre taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And theyre also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. Thats what it is. Its despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. Were going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed \\u2014 and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether youve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. Thats what were going to do. You dont even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. Theyre all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that theyve ever seen. Every single one. And its true. Its true. And theres love in the room. Theres great love in the room. So Id better finish strong. Otherwise, well blow it, and we cant let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, theres not one that I can think of where I said, \\\"Oh, gee, that wasnt great.\\\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Dont do that to me. Theyre already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was \\u2014 I think were actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a \\u2014 First of all, look at these crowds. Youd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, its about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for Americas renewal. And you saw that agenda, and its very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after theyre done. In their case, fortunately they dont read them because theyre pretty bad. Its a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. Were talking about just months. It cant come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. Its not affordable. People cant live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesnt matter what they are because you cant get the money anyway. Cant buy houses. Young people cant get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesnt. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. Id watch the \\u2014 and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? Thats all they talked about. This is the only administration that said were going to raise your taxes by four times what youre paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? Ive never heard it. Youre paying too much, were going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. Were going to give you more and its going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. Thats whats going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. Theyve spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. Its a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and theyre being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because were going to bring back car manufacturing and were going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. Were going to make them. We dont mind the \\u2014 We dont mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they dont agree with us, well put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. Theyve taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And were really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I dont even talk about it because of Covid. I dont even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years theyve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. Were going to get them all back. Were going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here its very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, Im staying in a nice one. Its called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where were leading by about 14 points. Hello. Ill see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And its a great building and the waitress comes over. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" Really nice person. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" \\\"Oh sir, its so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\\\" And she said, \\\"Actually,\\\" and I didnt know this, very little cash is given. Its all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money its just ridiculous. And they dont believe anything we say. Theyve just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, \\\"This shows the level of\\u2014\\\" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, \\\"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\\\" She said, \\\"What a great idea.\\\" I got my information from a very smart waitress. Thats better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. Its a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, theyre coming in. Theyre going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and youre not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and were going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst thats ever been seen anywhere in the world. Theres never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, hes incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they dont have to do anything but they want to. Theyre patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And theyre very tough people. But they dont want to do this job. Theyll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. Theyre the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries werent accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that were not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldnt take all the calls. \\\"Sir, sir, whats the problem?\\\" I said, \\\"You wont take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You wont take them back.\\\" \\\"Well sir, if youd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\\\" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldnt accept them. Theyd put planes on the runway so you couldnt land the plane. Theyd close the roads so you couldnt take the buses; theyd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \\\"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. Well take them back.\\\" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And were going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \\\"Look at, Im so proud of it.\\\" I think its one of the greatest \\u2014 it was done by the Border Patrol \\u2014 one of the greatest charts Ive ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. Thats pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \\\"Youve got to see this chart.\\\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But Im seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, thats the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, thats the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, its getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And were not going to do it. Were not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" We had a policy, \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \\\"You must give it to us. If you dont give it to us, there will be repercussions.\\\" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. Thats catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. Theres a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. Theyre coming from everywhere. Theyre coming at levels that weve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. Theyre coming from prisons. Theyre coming from jails. Theyre coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. Hed love to have you for dinner. Thats insane asylums. Theyre emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that weve never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because theyre taking their criminals and theyre putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but hes been getting great publicity because hes a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the countrys doing because their crime rate is down. And he said hes training all of these rough people. Theyre rough, rough, rough. Hes training them. And Ive been reading about this for two years. I think, \\\"Oh thats wonderful, lets take a look at it.\\\" But then I realize hes not training them; hes sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, hes sending them all to the United States. And hes different in that he doesnt say that. Hes trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesnt do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think were stupid. And they cant believe that theyre getting away with what theyre getting away with, but theyre not going to be getting away with it for long. Thats what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we wont be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because hes trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. Theyre down because theyre sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And youre seeing all the time. Thats why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation weve ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldnt believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyns heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachels mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. Ive also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people were talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. Hes a tough guy. The press doesnt like him because hes tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, whats happening, whats going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \\\"I dont want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\\\" But they said to him, \\\"Tell us, whats going wrong? Whats happening? What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Theres only one way youre going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\\\" True. He used a word I wouldnt use because I cant use that word. Because youd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \\\"He was a braggart.\\\" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said \\\"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\\\" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \\\"five years, sir, itll take five years, sir.\\\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. Its just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. \\\"How could you get along with him?\\\" Well, you know, its nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, youd say thats a wonderful thing. Now they say, \\\"How can you possibly do that?\\\" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. Hed like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. Were in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at whats happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. Hes running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really \\u2014 We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I dont think anybody has ever, what he did. Hes a real hero, a really great person. And hes running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. Were going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they werent doing things perfectly. So we said it doesnt kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didnt have one \\u2014 they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. Youve heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \\\"Why would you speak to him?\\\" I said, \\\"Because thats where the killing is.\\\" I dont have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: \\\"Dont ever do that. Dont ever do that again. Dont ever, ever do that again, youre going to stop.\\\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \\\"If you keep doing that, youre going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\\\" And he said, \\\"I understand, Your Excellency.\\\" He called me \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? Theyre selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, \\\"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\\\" I said, \\\"Youll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\\\" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. Its one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \\\"Whats Wrong With Our President?\\\". You dont even hear this. Youre not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They dont want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back \\u2014 and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I dont have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. Were going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and youre doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And theyre doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, \\\"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\\\" And the people at the shipyards said, \\\"This guy sort of knows what hes doing.\\\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but were going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are \\u2014 And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didnt have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we dont? No, no, were going to build an iron dome over our country, and were going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, Im going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. Its America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimers disease and many other diseases. Were going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I dont want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \\\"the 10 worst,\\\" I had to do it. I didnt want anybody to be confused. But this man said were going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. Were going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimers and so many other things. Were so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in womens sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nations once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nations capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things \\u2014 they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. Americas on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. Were going to take it, were going to make it a current \\u2014 I mean, were going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If were going to produce the new \\u2014 if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that were going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous \\u2014 literally, twice the electricity thats available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead were spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didnt work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If youre going to do this \\u2026 And by the way, Im all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, theyre going to be able to do it. And were going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. Its called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows Gods plan, or where lifes adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; hes an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \\\"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think its great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It wont make any difference. Please. Dont use any foul language.\\\" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \\\"It wont make any difference.\\\" Actually, it does, the storys not quite as good, but Ive been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. Ive got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. Hes a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies youve ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But hed get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklins been fantastic. And Im trying, Im just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. Im working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. Its your movement. Its the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It cant be stopped. It cant be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. Weve given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. Theyre not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And thats not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our countrys true potential \\u2014 and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. Its unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death \\u2014 and stared down those enemies \\u2014 to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many \\u2014 just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We cant forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful \\u2014 I think its so beautiful \\u2014 American flag. Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. Were going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down. To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win. Win, win, win, win, win, win. Nothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny \\u2014 and we will not fail. We will not fail. Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve. Americas future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before. And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\",\n          \"Fellow Democrats, fellow citizens: I thank you for the nomination youve offered me, and I especially thank you for choosing as my running mate the best partner any President ever had, Fritz Mondale. With gratitude and with determination I accept your nomination, and I am proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammered out at this convention. Fritz and I will mount a campaign that defines the real issues, a campaign that responds to the intelligence of the American people, a campaign that talks sense. And were going to beat the Republicans in November. Well win because we are the party of a great President who knew how to get reelected\\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And we are the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give em hell\\u2014Harry Truman. And as Truman said, he just told the truth and they thought it was hell. And were the party of a gallant man of spirit\\u2014John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And were the party of a great leader of compassion\\u2014Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the party of a great man who should have been President, who would have been one of the greatest Presidents in history\\u2014Hubert Horatio Hornblower\\u2014Humphrey. I have appreciated what this convention has said about Senator Humphrey, a great man who epitomized the spirit of the Democratic Party. And I would like to say that we are also the party of Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Edward Kennedy. Id like to say a personal word to Senator Kennedy. Ted, youre a tough competitor and a superb campaigner, and I can attest to that. Your speech before this convention was a magnificent statement of what the Democratic Party is and what it means to the people of this country and why a Democratic victory is so important this year. I reach out to you tonight, and I reach out to all those who supported you in your valiant and passionate campaign. Ted, your party needs and I need you. And I need your idealism and your dedication working for us. There is no doubt that even greater service lies ahead of you, and we are grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a larger cause to which your own life has been dedicated. I thank you for your support; well make great partners this fall in whipping the Republicans. We are Democrats and weve had our differences, but we share a bright vision of Americas future\\u2014a vision of a good life for all our people, a vision of a secure nation, a just society, a peaceful world, a strong America\\u2014confident and proud and united. And we have a memory of Franklin Roosevelt, 40 years ago, when he said that there are times in our history when concerns over our personal lives are overshadowed by our concern over \\\"what will happen to the county we have known.\\\" This is such a time, and I can tell you that the choice to be made this year can transform our own personal lives and the life of our country as well. During the last Presidential campaign, I crisscrossed this country and I listened to thousands and thousands of people-housewives and farmers, teachers and small business leaders, workers and students, the elderly and the poor, people of every race and every background and every walk of life. It was a powerful experience\\u2014a total immersion in the human reality of America. And I have now had another kind of total immersion\\u2014being President of the United States of America. Let me talk for a moment about what that job is like and what Ive learned from it. Ive learned that only the most complex and difficult task comes before me in the Oval Office. No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there. Ive learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. Im wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago. And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans. The poor and the jobless and the afflicted-theyve become part of me. My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. The life of every human being on Earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the Oval Office. The Presidents power for building and his power for destruction are awesome. And the powers greatest exactly where the stakes are highest\\u2014in matters of war and peace. And Ive learned something else, something that I have come to see with extraordinary clarity: Above all, I must look ahead, because the President of the United States is the steward of the Nations destiny. He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory. And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And thats why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. Thats why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort. The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. Thats why the election of 1980 is so important. Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but its more than that\\u2014its a choice between two futures. The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight. The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace. I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone. I see a future of justice\\u2014the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America. And I see a future of peace\\u2014a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well. That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. Its the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose. But there is another possible future. In that other future I see despair\\u2014despair of millions who would struggle for equal opportunity and a better life and struggle alone. And I see surrender\\u2014the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk\\u2014the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race. No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party. The consequences of those commitments and policies would drive us down the wrong road. Its up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny. The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present. But while we Democrats grapple with the real challenges of a real world, others talk about a world of tinsel and make-believe. Lets look for a moment at their make-believe world. In their fantasy America, inner-city people and farm workers and laborers do not exist. Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions\\u2014simple and wrong. Its a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions\\u2014it sounds too good to be true, and it is. The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Lets take a hard look at the consequences of our choice. You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength\\u2014steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third. Weve reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since Ive been President weve had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force\\u2014all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms. The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers. The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass. Its simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia\\u2014the Moscow Olympics. The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldnt go along with that. He doesnt seem to know what to do with the Russians. Hes not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them. As I look back at my first term, Im grateful that weve had a country for the full 4 years of peace. And thats what were going to have for the next 4 years-peace. Its only common sense that if America is to stay secure and at peace, we must encourage others to be peaceful as well. As you know, weve helped in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia where weve stood firm for racial justice and democracy. And we have also helped in the Middle East. Some have criticized the Camp David accords and theyve criticized some delays in the implementation of the Middle East peace treaty. Well, before I became President there was no Camp David accords and there was no Middle East peace treaty. Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Now thats the kind of future were offering\\u2014of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall. I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights. Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think its naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for? Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II. Ask those who are suffering for the sake of justice and liberty around the world. Ask the millions whove fled tyranny if America should stop speaking out for human principles. Ask the American people. I tell you that as long as I am President, we will hold high the banner of human rights, and you can depend on it. Here at home the choice between the two futures is equally important. In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies. We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress. Now, after 3 years of struggle, we have that program. The battle to secure Americas energy future has been fully and finally joined. Americans have cooperated with dramatic results. Weve reversed decades of dangerous and growing dependence on foreign oil. We are now importing 20 percent less oil\\u2014that is 1 1/2 million barrels of oil every day less than the day I took office. And with our new energy policy now in place, we can discover more, produce more, create more, and conserve more energy, and we will use American resources, American technology, and millions of American workers to do it with. Now, what do the Republicans propose? Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that weve done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with. Thats one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to \\\"unleash\\\" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. Thats it. That is it. Thats their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No ! THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and well begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November. When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and weve met them all head-on. Weve slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and were now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. Weve increased our exports dramatically. Weve reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs\\u2014the biggest increase in the history of our country. But the road is bumpy, and last years skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, were struggling to bring inflation under control. We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, weve laid the groundwork for a new economic age. Our economic renewal program for the 1980s will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. Itll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals\\u2014lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs. Its time to put all America back to work\\u2014but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things well rebuild together and build together:\\u2014new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;\\u2014a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;\\u2014industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;\\u2014job training for workers displaced by economic changes;\\u2014new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;\\u2014better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;\\u2014and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy. This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen. We are talking about the United States of America, and those who count this country out as an economic superpower are going to find out just how wrong they are. Were going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980s a time of growth for America. The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us. Their partys own Vice Presidential nominee said that Reagan-Kemp-Roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. He called it \\\"voodoo economics\\\". He suddenly changed his mind toward the end of the Republican Convention, but he was right the first time. Along with this gigantic tax cut, the new Republican leaders promise to protect retirement and health programs and to have massive increases in defense spending-and they claim they can balance the budget. If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial\\u2014and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose. But the American people will not stand for it. The Democratic Party has always embodied the hope of our people for justice, opportunity, and a better life, and weve worked in every way possible to strengthen the American family, to encourage self-reliance, and to follow the Old Testament admonition: \\\"Defend the poor and the fatherless; give justice to the afflicted and needy.\\\" Weve struggled to assure that no child in America ever goes to bed hungry, that no elderly couple in America has to live in a substandard home, and that no young person in America is excluded from college because the family is poor. But what have the Republicans proposed?\\u2014just an attack on everything that weve done in the achievement of social justice and decency that weve won in the last 50 years, ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelts first term. They would make social security voluntary. They would reverse our progress on the minimum wage, full employment laws, safety in the work place, and a healthy environment. Lately, as you know, the Republicans have been quoting Democratic Presidents. But who can blame them? Would you rather quote Herbert Hoover or Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Would you rather quote Richard Nixon or John Fitzgerald Kennedy? The Republicans have always been the party of privilege, but this year their leaders have gone even further. In their platform, they have repudiated the best traditions of their own party. Where is the conscience of Lincoln in the party of Lincoln? Whats become of their traditional Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility? Whats happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control? Now, I dont claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I dont claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, theyve not all been easy. But I will say this: Weve been tested under fire. Weve neither ducked nor hidden, and weve tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. Weve made tough decisions, and weve taken the heat for them. Weve made mistakes, and weve learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future. Weve done something else, perhaps even more important. In good times and bad, in the valleys and on the peaks, weve told people the truth, the hard truth, the truth that sometimes hurts. One truth that we Americans have learned is that our dream has been earned for progress and for peace. Look what our land has been through within our own memory\\u2014a great depression, a world war, a technological explosion, the civil rights revolution, the bitterness of Vietnam, the shame of Watergate, the twilight peace of nuclear terror. Through each of these momentous experiences weve learned the hard way about the world and about ourselves. But weve matured and weve grown as a nation and weve grown stronger. Weve learned the uses and the limitations of power. Weve learned the beauty and responsibility of freedom. Weve learned the value and the obligation of justice. And we have learned the necessity of peace. Some would argue that to master these lessons is somehow to limit our potential. That is not so. A nation which knows its true strengths, which sees its true challenges, which understands legitimate constraints, that nation\\u2014our nation\\u2014is far stronger than one which takes refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Democratic Party\\u2014the American people-have understood these fundamental truths. All of us can sympathize with the desire for easy answers. Theres often the temptation to substitute idle dreams for hard reality. The new Republican leaders are hoping that our Nation will succumb to that temptation this year, but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the American people. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill came to North America and he said, \\\"We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\\\" We Americans have courage. Americans have always been on the cutting edge of change. Weve always looked forward with anticipation and confidence. I still want the same thing that all of you want\\u2014a self-reliant neighborhood, strong families, work for the able-bodied and good medical care for the sick, opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old, equal rights and justice for all people. I want teachers eager to explain what a civilization really is, and I want students to understand their own needs and their own aims, but also the needs and yearnings of their neighbors. I want women free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves. I want our farmers growing crops to feed our Nation and the world, secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of us. I want workers to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country. And I want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new ideas. And I want minority citizens fully to join the mainstream of American life. And I want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our Nation, and Im determined to do it. I need for all of you to join me in fulfilling that vision. The choice, the choice between the two futures, could not be more clear. If we succumb to a dream world then well wake up to a nightmare. But if we start with reality and fight to make our dreams a reality, then Americans will have a good life, a life of meaning and purpose in a nation thats strong and secure. Above all, I want us to be what the Founders of our Nation meant us to become\\u2014the land of freedom, the land of peace, and the land of hope.

Lets get to business. All right. [Laughs.] [Applause.] So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. [Laughs.] [Applause.] I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. [Applause.] And to Coach Tim Walz \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 you are going to be an incredible vice president. [Applause.] And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but Im no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day and especially right now. And I know shes looking down smiling. [Applause.] I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. [Applause.] When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. [Applause.] They \\u2014 they fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. [Applause.] Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois; to Wisconsin \\u2014 [applause]; and wherever our parents jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones: a home filled with laughter and music \\u2014 Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, \\\"Stay close.\\\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \\\"Run, Kamala, run. Dont be afraid. Dont let anything stop you.\\\" [Applause.] From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the bay \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 in the Bay, you either live in the Hills or the Flatlands. We lived in the Flats, a beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 all who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us: Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother; Uncle Sherman; Aunt Mary; Uncle Freddy; Auntie Kris. None of them family by blood and all of them family by love. [Applause.] Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess \\u2014 and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. [Applause.] They instilled in us the values they personified: community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated \\u2014 with kindness, respect, and compassion. [Applause.] My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. [Applause.] And as the eldest child \\u2014 as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for womens health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. [Applause.] That was my mother. And she taught us \\u2014 and she always \\u2014 she also taught us \\u2014 and she also taught us \\\"and never do anything half-assed.\\\" [Applause.] And that is a direct quote \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 a direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering. And they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and C- \\u2014 Constance Baker Motley \\u2014 those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didnt want to go home. So, one day, I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. [Applause.] This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor \\u2014 to protect people like Wanda \\u2014 because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. [Applause.] As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for a simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. [Applause.] And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. [Applause.] And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: \\\"Kamala Harris, for the people.\\\" [Applause.] And to be clear \\u2014 and to be clear, my entire career, Ive only had one client: the people. [Applause.] And so, on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with \\u2014 people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. [Applause.] And with this election \\u2014 and \\u2014 [laughs] \\u2014 and with this election, our nation \\u2014 our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past; a chance to chart a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 not \\u2014 not as members of any one party or faction but as Americans. [Applause.] And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know I promise to be a president for all Americans. [Applause.] You can always trust me to put country above party and self; to hold sacred Americas fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause.] I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical, and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. [Applause.] From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my lifes work. [Applause.] As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. [Applause.] I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 for seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn, but we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. [Applause.] And thats the fight we are in right now: a fight for Americas future. [Applause.] Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. [Applause.] In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. [Laughter.] But the consequences \\u2014 but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. [Applause.] Consider \\u2014 consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and separately \\u2014 and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider \\u2014 consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol; his explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy; his explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Consider \\u2014 consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. [Applause.] And we know \\u2014 and we know what a second Trump term would look like. Its all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But, America -- Audience: We are not going back! The Vice President: \\u2014 we are not going back. [Applause.] We are not going back. We are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. [Applause.] We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. [Applause.] America, we are not going back. Audience: Were not going back! Were not going back! Were not going back! The Vice President: And we are charting \\u2014 and we are charting a new way forward \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class, because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to Americas success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [Applause.] And Ill tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them, because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. Thats why we will create what I call an opportunity economy \\u2014 an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy, and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. [Applause.] And we will end Americas housing shortage \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and protect Social Security and Medicare. [Applause.] Now compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Not \\u2014 he doesnt actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add -- Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: \\u2014 up to $5 trillion to the national debt. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax \\u2014 call it a \\\"Trump tax\\\" \\u2014 that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. [Applause.] Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. [Applause.] But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And lets be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \\\"I did it, and Im proud to have done it.\\\" End quote. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, Ill tell you, over the past two years, Ive traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is whats happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. Audience: Booo -- And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on womens miscarriages and abortions. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Simply put, they are out of their minds. [Applause.] And one must ask \\u2014 one must ask: Why exactly is it that they dont trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. [Applause.] And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. [Applause.] In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake: the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride \\u2014 [applause]; the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis \\u2014 [applause]; and the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. [Applause.] With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. [Applause.] I know \\u2014 I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. [Applause.] We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. [Applause.] And, America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. [Applause.] As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. [Applause.] And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence; that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century; and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could, quote, \\\"do whatever the hell they want.\\\" Audience: Booo -- The Vice President: Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russias plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response \\u2014 over 50 countries \\u2014 to defend against Putins aggression. [Applause.] And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO Allies. [Applause.] With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. [Applause.] And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israels right to defend itself \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7 \\u2014 [applause] \\u2014 including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. [Applause.] Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [Applause.] And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un, who are rooting for Trump \\u2014 who are rooting for Trump. [Applause.] Because, you know, they know \\u2014 they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump wont hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [Applause.] And as president, I will never waver in defense of Americas security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. [Applause.] Audience: USA! USA! USA! The Vice President: So, fellow Americans \\u2014 fellow Americans, I \\u2014 I love our country with all my heart. [Applause.] Everywhere I go \\u2014 everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world \\u2014 that here, in this country, anything is possible; that nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. [Applause.] That none of us \\u2014 none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. [Applause.] And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are; you show them who you are. [Applause.] America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. [Applause.] We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith: to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth \\u2014 the privilege and pride of being an American. [Applause.] So, lets get out there, lets fight for it. Lets get out there, lets vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. [Applause.] Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. [Applause.]\",\n          \"Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \\\"Bob.\\\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you. Friends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we will do it right. Were going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday. As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \\\"Tell us what happened, please.\\\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and youll never hear it from me a second time, because its actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it. Behind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which Im very lucky I didnt do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \\\"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\\\" And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage. These are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that. The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual. This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didnt move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front. Nobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isnt the reason that they didnt move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead. They knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And theres an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that. And I said, \\\"Why is there so much blood?\\\" He said, \\\"Its the ears, they bleed more.\\\" So we learned something. But they just \\u2014 They just, this beautiful crowd, they didnt want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didnt want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True. Incredible people. Theyre incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassins life. Took him out. Im not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here. [Crowd chants \\\"Yes, you are.\\\"] Thank you. But Im not. And Ill tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didnt know I was looking out; they thought it was over. But I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \\\"Fight, fight, fight.\\\" Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, youve all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it. For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be. Were never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense. He was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was. I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and theyre going to do something very special when they get it. But we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days weve raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just \\u2014 called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan. And again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \\\"Well, Im going to be sending a lot of money, but it cant compensate.\\\" They all said the same thing: \\\"Youre right, sir; we appreciate so much what youre doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\\\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now theyre doing very well. Theyre going to be OK. Theyre going to be doing very well. Theyre warriors. So now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need. Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room. [Crowd chants, \\\"We love Trump.\\\"] Thank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure. No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never. And everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. Were going to turn our nation around and were going to do it very quickly. Thank you. This election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again. In an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens \\u2014 we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is whats been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country. And very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity \\u2014 thrown out of court. If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which Ive been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. Were going to win it anyway. But worthy of our people. On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldnt it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so \\u2026 I also want to thank my entire family \\u2014 Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren. You saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasnt he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation hes had in about \\u2014 maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife \\u2014 very far away. I wont tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place. And my people called and he said, \\\"Yeah, I wont be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I cant do it.\\\" And they came and they said, \\\"Dana wont be able to do it.\\\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \\\"Well, you know, thats too bad.\\\" But I understand, hes away and its good. Its good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \\\"Sir, Dana just called; hes going to do it.\\\" And his wife, she said, \\\"You cant turn him down. You just cant do it. You have to go.\\\" Thats a good wife. So he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now hes going to get on the plane in a little while and hes going to go back home to his wife. But theyre great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because thats not easy. And Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \\\"I want to be a part of it.\\\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, hes amazing. Everyone loves him. I didnt even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think hes making so much money he doesnt know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ... And then we have my other friend, and Ive known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. Thats Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. Hes a beautiful man. But they all wanted to be here. They called \\u2026 And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy. You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There arent a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much. Followed by \\u2026 Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didnt want to really come up here. But he was so great. And hes such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom. Theyve got to stop that because theyre destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, wed have a much stronger and better country. And Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, hes good. I like his wife even better, by the way. Shes here. Thank you, Jason. But Im thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha. Hes going to be a great vice president, hes going to be great. Hell be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \\\"Were going to try and stop MAGA.\\\" MAGA is \\\"Make America Great Again.\\\" What are you going to stop? Theres nothing to stop. Then they say, \\\"Oh, thats right.\\\" Its very tough to fight it. And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but hes going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., youre going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride. And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of \\u2014 oh, there they are. There they are, thats \\u2014 You are so easy to spot. And Green Bays going to have a good team this year, right? Theyre going to have a good team. Theyre going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesnt like it, but its true. Youre going to have a very good team this year. And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic \\u2026 development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. Ill be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. Were going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you. I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether youre a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before. We were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobodys ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much. Right to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. Weve got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebodys terminally ill. And hopefully theres nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. Theyre terminally ill and they cant use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you cant do it. Theyve been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasnt that easy. The insurance companies didnt want to do it. They didnt want the risk. The labs didnt want to do it because if it didnt work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didnt want to do it. The doctors didnt want to have it on their record. So I got everybody into an office \\u2014 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but its not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying \\u2014 just die \\u2014 we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where theyre not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. Theyre going to get it really fast, and whats happened is were saving thousands and thousands of lives. Its incredible. Right to Try. Its \\u2026 great feeling. Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world. But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country. Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline. We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. Theyve never seen anything like it. We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and its taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. Its a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobodys ever seen anything like it. Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe whats happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration. Its time for a change. This administration cant come close to solving the problems. Were dealing with very tough, very fierce people. Theyre fierce people. And we dont have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then theyre fierce. Then theyre fierce. So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what theyre doing? But by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy\\u2026 Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobodys ever seen before, and well end lots of different things. Well start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. Well do it more. Now, people dont realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. Well do it again, but well do it even better. I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which Ive already built. On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \\\"Oh, thats OK. We wont go to Congress.\\\" I call it an \\\"invasion.\\\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \\\"Im going to take a little of that money, because this is an invasion.\\\" And we built \\u2014 Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because whats more, whats better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country thats killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. Were not going to let that happen. I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke. I watched the other day on a show called \\\"Deface the Nation,\\\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \\\"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\\\" And they said to me, Well, I think thats about it. They werent going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us. And then we had that horrible, horrible result that well never let happen again. The election result. Were never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. Were never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened. This is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. Im not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that hes done to this country is unthinkable. Its unthinkable. Together, we will restore vision, strength, competence and were going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. Its all common sense. Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it. We had no inflation, soaring incomes, were going \\u2014 Nobodys \\u2014 Nobody can believe it. You cant believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse. And the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what youre making, it doesnt matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest theyve ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. Theyre not putting away anything. Theyre barely living. Theyre going into saving accounts. Theyre taking out their money to live because of inflation. Inflation, remember, its called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country thats suffered great inflation. Weve suffered the worst inflation weve ever had. But go back and see whats happened to those countries. Weve had the worst inflation weve ever had under this person. But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. Its been a tremendous failure. Today, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know whos taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens. And you know whos being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because theyre taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And theyre also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it. Thank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much. Inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. Thats what it is. Its despair and depression. We cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. Were going to be a great nation again. Thank you. With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed \\u2014 and it will be fixed very, very quickly. So tonight, whether youve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. Thats what were going to do. You dont even hear about the American dream anymore. With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited. And by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. Theyre all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that theyve ever seen. Every single one. And its true. Its true. And theres love in the room. Theres great love in the room. So Id better finish strong. Otherwise, well blow it, and we cant let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, theres not one that I can think of where I said, \\\"Oh, gee, that wasnt great.\\\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Dont do that to me. Theyre already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea. No, we had a, this was a great convention. This was \\u2014 I think were actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a \\u2014 First of all, look at these crowds. Youd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, its about love. This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for Americas renewal. And you saw that agenda, and its very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after theyre done. In their case, fortunately they dont read them because theyre pretty bad. Its a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you. A Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. Were talking about just months. It cant come fast enough. We have to get it done. First, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. Its not affordable. People cant live like this. Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesnt matter what they are because you cant get the money anyway. Cant buy houses. Young people cant get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration. Republicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesnt. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world. With numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. Id watch the \\u2014 and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? Thats all they talked about. This is the only administration that said were going to raise your taxes by four times what youre paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? Ive never heard it. Youre paying too much, were going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. Were going to give you more and its going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. Thats whats going to pay off our debt. And next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. Theyve spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. Its a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy. And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas. And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car. And right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and theyre being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because were going to bring back car manufacturing and were going to bring it back fast. They are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. Were going to make them. We dont mind the \\u2014 We dont mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they dont agree with us, well put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States. We have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. Theyve taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And were really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I dont even talk about it because of Covid. I dont even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus. We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation. The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years theyve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. Were going to get them all back. Were going to get them all back, every single one of them. At the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here its very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, Im staying in a nice one. Its called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips. And I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where were leading by about 14 points. Hello. Ill see you there very soon, everybody. And we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And its a great building and the waitress comes over. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" Really nice person. \\\"Hows everything going?\\\" \\\"Oh sir, its so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\\\" I said, \\\"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\\\" And she said, \\\"Actually,\\\" and I didnt know this, very little cash is given. Its all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money its just ridiculous. And they dont believe anything we say. Theyve just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more. And I said, \\\"This shows the level of\\u2014\\\" You know, most people who go out they hire consultants. They pay them of dollars. But I said to her, \\\"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\\\" She said, \\\"What a great idea.\\\" I got my information from a very smart waitress. Thats better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. Its a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money. I am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, theyre coming in. Theyre going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and youre not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare. Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and were going to do it very rapidly. But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst thats ever been seen anywhere in the world. Theres never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, hes incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they dont have to do anything but they want to. Theyre patriots. Brandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And theyre very tough people. But they dont want to do this job. Theyll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. Theyre the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries werent accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that were not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldnt take all the calls. \\\"Sir, sir, whats the problem?\\\" I said, \\\"You wont take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You wont take them back.\\\" \\\"Well sir, if youd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\\\" In 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldnt accept them. Theyd put planes on the runway so you couldnt land the plane. Theyd close the roads so you couldnt take the buses; theyd all have to turn back. As soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \\\"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. Well take them back.\\\" At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And were going to do that on Day 1. That means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders. And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \\\"Look at, Im so proud of it.\\\" I think its one of the greatest \\u2014 it was done by the Border Patrol \\u2014 one of the greatest charts Ive ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. Thats pretty good. Wow. Last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \\\"Youve got to see this chart.\\\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But Im seeing it now and I was very proud. If you look at the arrow on the bottom, thats the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, thats the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, its getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers. Look what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country. We ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil. Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back. The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And were not going to do it. Were not going to stand for it. They suspended wall construction, ended \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" We had a policy, \\\"Remain in Mexico.\\\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \\\"You must give it to us. If you dont give it to us, there will be repercussions.\\\" And they gave it to us, but not easy. Canceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. Thats catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. Theres a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration. The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. Theyre coming from everywhere. Theyre coming at levels that weve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. Theyre coming from prisons. Theyre coming from jails. Theyre coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. Hed love to have you for dinner. Thats insane asylums. Theyre emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that weve never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because theyre taking their criminals and theyre putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but hes been getting great publicity because hes a wonderful shepherd of the country. He says how well the countrys doing because their crime rate is down. And he said hes training all of these rough people. Theyre rough, rough, rough. Hes training them. And Ive been reading about this for two years. I think, \\\"Oh thats wonderful, lets take a look at it.\\\" But then I realize hes not training them; hes sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, hes sending them all to the United States. And hes different in that he doesnt say that. Hes trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesnt do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already. But we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think were stupid. And they cant believe that theyre getting away with what theyre getting away with, but theyre not going to be getting away with it for long. Thats what I can tell you. In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we wont be able, we will not be able to have it there. In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because hes trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. Theyre down because theyre sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen. And youre seeing all the time. Thats why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation weve ever had. Just recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldnt believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyns heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now. I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachels mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same. Ive also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people were talking about. These were incredible people who died. Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe. As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world. I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. Hes a tough guy. The press doesnt like him because hes tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, whats happening, whats going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \\\"I dont want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\\\" But they said to him, \\\"Tell us, whats going wrong? Whats happening? What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Theres only one way youre going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\\\" True. He used a word I wouldnt use because I cant use that word. Because youd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \\\"He was a braggart.\\\" I am not a braggart. But Viktor Orban said it. He said \\\"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\\\" The whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen. Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing. We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \\\"five years, sir, itll take five years, sir.\\\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. Its just some of the fools on top that are woke. I got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that. \\\"How could you get along with him?\\\" Well, you know, its nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, youd say thats a wonderful thing. Now they say, \\\"How can you possibly do that?\\\" But no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. Hed like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth. Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. Were in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at whats happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground. It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. Hes running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight. But Sam, I think, paid really \\u2014 We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I dont think anybody has ever, what he did. Hes a real hero, a really great person. And hes running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown. And we also left behind $85 billion dollars worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens. Emboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. Were going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they werent doing things perfectly. So we said it doesnt kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didnt have one \\u2014 they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. Youve heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \\\"Why would you speak to him?\\\" I said, \\\"Because thats where the killing is.\\\" I dont have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it. And I told him: \\\"Dont ever do that. Dont ever do that again. Dont ever, ever do that again, youre going to stop.\\\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \\\"If you keep doing that, youre going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\\\" And he said, \\\"I understand, Your Excellency.\\\" He called me \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \\\"Your Excellency.\\\" I doubt it. The other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? Theyre selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them. But think of it. He actually said to me, \\\"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\\\" I said, \\\"Youll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\\\" But he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack. And they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways. We gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. Its one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now. We were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \\\"Whats Wrong With Our President?\\\". You dont even hear this. Youre not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They dont want to mention it, but now maybe they will. And to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back \\u2014 and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price. With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over. I dont have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland. And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. Were going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and youre doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And theyre doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts. I said, \\\"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\\\" And the people at the shipyards said, \\\"This guy sort of knows what hes doing.\\\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but were going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states. Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are \\u2014 And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didnt have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good. But now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we dont? No, no, were going to build an iron dome over our country, and were going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, Im going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. Its America first, America first. We will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimers disease and many other diseases. Were going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I dont want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \\\"the 10 worst,\\\" I had to do it. I didnt want anybody to be confused. But this man said were going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. Were going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimers and so many other things. Were so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done. We will not have men playing in womens sports. That will end immediately. And we will restore and renovate our nations once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nations capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things \\u2014 they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C. Americas on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. Were going to take it, were going to make it a current \\u2014 I mean, were going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it. We have to produce massive amounts of energy. If were going to produce the new \\u2014 if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that were going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous \\u2014 literally, twice the electricity thats available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead were spending places where they recharge electric cars. They built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didnt work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If youre going to do this \\u2026 And by the way, Im all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, theyre going to be able to do it. And were going to make that change on Day 1. So, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. Its called America. We live in a world of miracles. None of us knows Gods plan, or where lifes adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; hes an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \\\"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think its great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It wont make any difference. Please. Dont use any foul language.\\\" I was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \\\"It wont make any difference.\\\" Actually, it does, the storys not quite as good, but Ive been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest. Ive got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. Hes a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies youve ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too. But hed get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklins been fantastic. And Im trying, Im just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. Im working hard on it, Franklin. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love. The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. Its your movement. Its the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It cant be stopped. It cant be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America. For too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. Weve given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families. I am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. Theyre not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that. We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright. But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And thats not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our countrys true potential \\u2014 and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together. It is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. Its unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic. They fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death \\u2014 and stared down those enemies \\u2014 to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many \\u2014 just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We cant forget those people. We have to cherish those people. And building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God. Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful \\u2014 I think its so beautiful \\u2014 American flag. Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. Were going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down. To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win. Win, win, win, win, win, win. Nothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny \\u2014 and we will not fail. We will not fail. Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve. Americas future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before. And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\",\n          \"Fellow Democrats, fellow citizens: I thank you for the nomination youve offered me, and I especially thank you for choosing as my running mate the best partner any President ever had, Fritz Mondale. With gratitude and with determination I accept your nomination, and I am proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammered out at this convention. Fritz and I will mount a campaign that defines the real issues, a campaign that responds to the intelligence of the American people, a campaign that talks sense. And were going to beat the Republicans in November. Well win because we are the party of a great President who knew how to get reelected\\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And we are the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give em hell\\u2014Harry Truman. And as Truman said, he just told the truth and they thought it was hell. And were the party of a gallant man of spirit\\u2014John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And were the party of a great leader of compassion\\u2014Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the party of a great man who should have been President, who would have been one of the greatest Presidents in history\\u2014Hubert Horatio Hornblower\\u2014Humphrey. I have appreciated what this convention has said about Senator Humphrey, a great man who epitomized the spirit of the Democratic Party. And I would like to say that we are also the party of Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Edward Kennedy. Id like to say a personal word to Senator Kennedy. Ted, youre a tough competitor and a superb campaigner, and I can attest to that. Your speech before this convention was a magnificent statement of what the Democratic Party is and what it means to the people of this country and why a Democratic victory is so important this year. I reach out to you tonight, and I reach out to all those who supported you in your valiant and passionate campaign. Ted, your party needs and I need you. And I need your idealism and your dedication working for us. There is no doubt that even greater service lies ahead of you, and we are grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a larger cause to which your own life has been dedicated. I thank you for your support; well make great partners this fall in whipping the Republicans. We are Democrats and weve had our differences, but we share a bright vision of Americas future\\u2014a vision of a good life for all our people, a vision of a secure nation, a just society, a peaceful world, a strong America\\u2014confident and proud and united. And we have a memory of Franklin Roosevelt, 40 years ago, when he said that there are times in our history when concerns over our personal lives are overshadowed by our concern over \\\"what will happen to the county we have known.\\\" This is such a time, and I can tell you that the choice to be made this year can transform our own personal lives and the life of our country as well. During the last Presidential campaign, I crisscrossed this country and I listened to thousands and thousands of people-housewives and farmers, teachers and small business leaders, workers and students, the elderly and the poor, people of every race and every background and every walk of life. It was a powerful experience\\u2014a total immersion in the human reality of America. And I have now had another kind of total immersion\\u2014being President of the United States of America. Let me talk for a moment about what that job is like and what Ive learned from it. Ive learned that only the most complex and difficult task comes before me in the Oval Office. No easy answers are found there, because no easy questions come there. Ive learned that for a President, experience is the best guide to the right decisions. Im wiser tonight than I was 4 years ago. And I have learned that the Presidency is a place of compassion. My own heart is burdened for the troubled Americans. The poor and the jobless and the afflicted-theyve become part of me. My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. The life of every human being on Earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the Oval Office. The Presidents power for building and his power for destruction are awesome. And the powers greatest exactly where the stakes are highest\\u2014in matters of war and peace. And Ive learned something else, something that I have come to see with extraordinary clarity: Above all, I must look ahead, because the President of the United States is the steward of the Nations destiny. He must protect our children and the children they will have and the children of generations to follow. He must speak and act for them. That is his burden and his glory. And that is why a President cannot yield to the shortsighted demands, no matter how rich or powerful the special interests might be that make those demands. And thats why the President cannot bend to the passions of the moment, however popular they might be. Thats why the President must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listeners would rather hear the promise of comfort. The President is a servant of today, but his true constituency is the future. Thats why the election of 1980 is so important. Some have said it makes no difference who wins this election. They are wrong. This election is a stark choice between two men, two parties, two sharply different pictures of what America is and what the world is, but its more than that\\u2014its a choice between two futures. The year 2000 is just less than 20 years away, just four Presidential elections after this one. Children born this year will come of age in the 21st century. The time to shape the world of the year 2000 is now. The decisions of the next few years will set our course, perhaps an irreversible course, and the most important of all choices will be made by the American people at the polls less than 3 months from tonight. The choice could not be more clear nor the consequences more crucial. In one of the futures we can choose, the future that you and I have been building together, I see security and justice and peace. I see a future of economic security-security that will come from tapping our own great resources of oil and gas, coal and sunlight, and from building the tools and technology and factories for a revitalized economy based on jobs and stable prices for everyone. I see a future of justice\\u2014the justice of good jobs, decent health care, quality education, a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion; the simple human justice of equal rights for all men and for all women, guaranteed equal rights at last under the Constitution of the United States of America. And I see a future of peace\\u2014a peace born of wisdom and based on a fairness toward all countries of the world, a peace guaranteed both by American military strength and by American moral strength as well. That is the future I want for all people, a future of confidence and hope and a good life. Its the future America must choose, and with your help and with your commitment, it is the future America will choose. But there is another possible future. In that other future I see despair\\u2014despair of millions who would struggle for equal opportunity and a better life and struggle alone. And I see surrender\\u2014the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil, the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich, service cuts for the poor, and massive inflation for everyone. And I see risk\\u2014the risk of international confrontation, the risk of an uncontrollable, unaffordable, and unwinnable nuclear arms race. No one, Democrat or Republican either, consciously seeks such a future, and I do not claim that my opponent does. But I do question the disturbing commitments and policies already made by him and by those with him who have now captured control of the Republican Party. The consequences of those commitments and policies would drive us down the wrong road. Its up to all of us to make sure America rejects this alarming and even perilous destiny. The only way to build a better future is to start with the realities of the present. But while we Democrats grapple with the real challenges of a real world, others talk about a world of tinsel and make-believe. Lets look for a moment at their make-believe world. In their fantasy America, inner-city people and farm workers and laborers do not exist. Women, like children, are to be seen but not heard. The problems of working women are simply ignored. The elderly do not need Medicare. The young do not need more help in getting a better education. Workers do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work. In their fantasy world, all the complex global changes of the world since World War II have never happened. In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions\\u2014simple and wrong. Its a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later. No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions\\u2014it sounds too good to be true, and it is. The path of fantasy leads to irresponsibility. The path of reality leads to hope and peace. The two paths could not be more different, nor could the futures to which they lead. Lets take a hard look at the consequences of our choice. You and I have been working toward a more secure future by rebuilding our military strength\\u2014steadily, carefully, and responsibly. The Republicans talk about military strength, but they were in office for 8 out of the last 11 years, and in the face of a growing Soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third. Weve reversed the Republican decline in defense. Every year since Ive been President weve had real increases in our commitment to a stronger Nation, increases which are prudent and rational. There is no doubt that the United States of America can meet a threat from the Soviet Union. Our modernized strategic forces, a revitalized NATO, the Trident submarine, the Cruise missile, the Rapid Deployment Force\\u2014all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation. Deeds, not words; fact, not fiction. We must and we will continue to build our own defenses. We must and we will continue to seek balanced reductions in nuclear arms. The new leaders of the Republican Party, in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record, have now promised to launch an all-out nuclear arms race. This would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arms limitation agreement. There can be no winners in such an arms race, and all the people of the Earth can be the losers. The Republican nominee advocates abandoning arms control policies which have been important and supported by every Democratic President since Harry, Truman, and also by every Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower. This radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril. You and I must never let this come to pass. Its simple to call for a new arms race, but when armed aggression threatens world peace, tough-sounding talk like that is not enough. A President must act responsibly. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, we moved quickly to take action. I suspended some grain sales to the Soviet Union; I called for draft registration; and I joined wholeheartedly with the Congress and with the U.S. Olympic Committee and led more than 60 other nations in boycotting the big propaganda show in Russia\\u2014the Moscow Olympics. The Republican leader opposed two of these forceful but peaceful actions, and he waffled on the third. But when we asked him what he would do about aggression in Southwest Asia, he suggested blockading Cuba. [Laughter] Even his running mate wouldnt go along with that. He doesnt seem to know what to do with the Russians. Hes not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them. As I look back at my first term, Im grateful that weve had a country for the full 4 years of peace. And thats what were going to have for the next 4 years-peace. Its only common sense that if America is to stay secure and at peace, we must encourage others to be peaceful as well. As you know, weve helped in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia where weve stood firm for racial justice and democracy. And we have also helped in the Middle East. Some have criticized the Camp David accords and theyve criticized some delays in the implementation of the Middle East peace treaty. Well, before I became President there was no Camp David accords and there was no Middle East peace treaty. Before Camp David, Israel and Egypt were poised across barbed wire, confronting each other with guns and tanks and planes. But afterward, they talked face-to-face with each other across a peace table, and they also communicated through their own Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv. Now thats the kind of future were offering\\u2014of peace to the Middle East if the Democrats are reelected in the fall. I am very proud that nearly half the aid that our country has ever given to Israel in the 32 years of her existence has come during my administration. Unlike our Republican predecessors, we have never stopped nor slowed that aid to Israel. And as long as I am President, we will never do so. Our commitment is clear: security and peace for Israel; peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. But if the world is to have a future of freedom as well as peace, America must continue to defend human rights. Now listen to this: The new Republican leaders oppose our human rights policy. They want to scrap it. They seem to think its naive for America to stand up for freedom and democracy. Just what do they think we should stand up for? Ask the former political prisoners who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human rights. Ask the dissidents in the Soviet Union about our commitment to human rights. Ask the Hungarian Americans, ask the Polish Americans, listen to Pope John Paul II. Ask those who are suffering for the sake of justice and liberty around the world. Ask the millions whove fled tyranny if America should stop speaking out for human principles. Ask the American people. I tell you that as long as I am President, we will hold high the banner of human rights, and you can depend on it. Here at home the choice between the two futures is equally important. In the long run, nothing is more crucial to the future of America than energy; nothing was so disastrously neglected in the past. Long after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Republicans in the White House had still done nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our Nation. Then, as now, their policy was dictated by the big oil companies. We Democrats fought hard to rally our Nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program, a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress. Now, after 3 years of struggle, we have that program. The battle to secure Americas energy future has been fully and finally joined. Americans have cooperated with dramatic results. Weve reversed decades of dangerous and growing dependence on foreign oil. We are now importing 20 percent less oil\\u2014that is 1 1/2 million barrels of oil every day less than the day I took office. And with our new energy policy now in place, we can discover more, produce more, create more, and conserve more energy, and we will use American resources, American technology, and millions of American workers to do it with. Now, what do the Republicans propose? Basically, their energy program has two parts. The first part is to get rid of almost everything that weve done for the American public in the last 3 years. They want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuels program. They want to slash the solar energy incentives, the conservation programs, aid to mass transit, aid to elderly Americans to help pay their fuel bills. They want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit. And while they are at it, the Republicans would like to gut the Clean Air Act. They never liked it to begin with. Thats one part of their program; the other part is worse. To replace what we have built, this is what they propose: to destroy the windfall profits tax and to \\\"unleash\\\" the oil companies and let them solve the energy problem for us. Thats it. That is it. Thats their whole program. There is no more. Can this Nation accept such an outrageous program?AUDIENCE. No ! THE PRESIDENT. No! We Democrats will fight it every step of the way, and well begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in November. When I took office, I inherited a heavy load of serious economic problems besides energy, and weve met them all head-on. Weve slashed Government regulations and put free enterprise back into the airlines, the trucking and the financial systems of our country, and were now doing the same thing for the railroads. This is the greatest change in the relationship between Government and business since the New Deal. Weve increased our exports dramatically. Weve reversed the decline in the basic research and development, and we have created more than 8 million new jobs\\u2014the biggest increase in the history of our country. But the road is bumpy, and last years skyrocketing OPEC price increases have helped to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis. We took forceful action, and interest rates have now fallen, the dollar is stable and, although we still have a battle on our hands, were struggling to bring inflation under control. We are now at the critical point, a turning point in our economic history of our country. But because we made the hard decisions, because we have guided our Nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition, weve laid the groundwork for a new economic age. Our economic renewal program for the 1980s will meet our immediate need for jobs and attack the very same, long-range problem that caused unemployment and inflation in the first place. Itll move America simultaneously towards our five great economic goals\\u2014lower inflation, better productivity, revitalization of American industry, energy security, and jobs. Its time to put all America back to work\\u2014but not in make-work, in real work. And there is real work in modernizing American industries and creating new industries for America as well. Here are just a few things well rebuild together and build together:\\u2014new industries to turn our own coal and shale and farm products into fuel for our cars and trucks and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our homes;\\u2014a modern transportation system of railbeds and ports to make American coal into a powerful rival of OPEC oil;\\u2014industries that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communications to serve millions of American homes and offices and factories;\\u2014job training for workers displaced by economic changes;\\u2014new investment pinpointed in regions and communities where jobs are needed most;\\u2014better mass transit in our cities and in between cities;\\u2014and a whole new generation of American jobs to make homes and vehicles and buildings that will house us and move us in comfort with a lot less energy. This is important, too: I have no doubt that the ingenuity, and dedication of the American people can make every single one of these things happen. We are talking about the United States of America, and those who count this country out as an economic superpower are going to find out just how wrong they are. Were going to share in the exciting enterprise of making the 1980s a time of growth for America. The Republican alternative is the biggest tax giveaway in history. They call it Reagan-Kemp-Roth; I call it a free lunch that Americans cannot afford. The Republican tax program offers rebates to the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us. Their partys own Vice Presidential nominee said that Reagan-Kemp-Roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. He called it \\\"voodoo economics\\\". He suddenly changed his mind toward the end of the Republican Convention, but he was right the first time. Along with this gigantic tax cut, the new Republican leaders promise to protect retirement and health programs and to have massive increases in defense spending-and they claim they can balance the budget. If they are serious about these promises, and they say they are, then a close analysis shows that the entire rest of the Government would have to be abolished, everything from education to farm programs, from the G.I. bill to the night watchman at the Lincoln Memorial\\u2014and their budget would still be in the red. The only alternative would be to build more printing presses to print cheap money. Either way, the American people lose. But the American people will not stand for it. The Democratic Party has always embodied the hope of our people for justice, opportunity, and a better life, and weve worked in every way possible to strengthen the American family, to encourage self-reliance, and to follow the Old Testament admonition: \\\"Defend the poor and the fatherless; give justice to the afflicted and needy.\\\" Weve struggled to assure that no child in America ever goes to bed hungry, that no elderly couple in America has to live in a substandard home, and that no young person in America is excluded from college because the family is poor. But what have the Republicans proposed?\\u2014just an attack on everything that weve done in the achievement of social justice and decency that weve won in the last 50 years, ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelts first term. They would make social security voluntary. They would reverse our progress on the minimum wage, full employment laws, safety in the work place, and a healthy environment. Lately, as you know, the Republicans have been quoting Democratic Presidents. But who can blame them? Would you rather quote Herbert Hoover or Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Would you rather quote Richard Nixon or John Fitzgerald Kennedy? The Republicans have always been the party of privilege, but this year their leaders have gone even further. In their platform, they have repudiated the best traditions of their own party. Where is the conscience of Lincoln in the party of Lincoln? Whats become of their traditional Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility? Whats happened to their commitment to a safe and sane arms control? Now, I dont claim perfection for the Democratic Party. I dont claim that every decision that we have made has been right or popular; certainly, theyve not all been easy. But I will say this: Weve been tested under fire. Weve neither ducked nor hidden, and weve tackled the great central issues of our time, the historic challenges of peace and energy, which have been ignored for years. Weve made tough decisions, and weve taken the heat for them. Weve made mistakes, and weve learned from them. But we have built the foundation now for a better future. Weve done something else, perhaps even more important. In good times and bad, in the valleys and on the peaks, weve told people the truth, the hard truth, the truth that sometimes hurts. One truth that we Americans have learned is that our dream has been earned for progress and for peace. Look what our land has been through within our own memory\\u2014a great depression, a world war, a technological explosion, the civil rights revolution, the bitterness of Vietnam, the shame of Watergate, the twilight peace of nuclear terror. Through each of these momentous experiences weve learned the hard way about the world and about ourselves. But weve matured and weve grown as a nation and weve grown stronger. Weve learned the uses and the limitations of power. Weve learned the beauty and responsibility of freedom. Weve learned the value and the obligation of justice. And we have learned the necessity of peace. Some would argue that to master these lessons is somehow to limit our potential. That is not so. A nation which knows its true strengths, which sees its true challenges, which understands legitimate constraints, that nation\\u2014our nation\\u2014is far stronger than one which takes refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia. The Democratic Party\\u2014the American people-have understood these fundamental truths. All of us can sympathize with the desire for easy answers. Theres often the temptation to substitute idle dreams for hard reality. The new Republican leaders are hoping that our Nation will succumb to that temptation this year, but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the American people. Three weeks after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill came to North America and he said, \\\"We have not journeyed all this way across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\\\" We Americans have courage. Americans have always been on the cutting edge of change. Weve always looked forward with anticipation and confidence. I still want the same thing that all of you want\\u2014a self-reliant neighborhood, strong families, work for the able-bodied and good medical care for the sick, opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old, equal rights and justice for all people. I want teachers eager to explain what a civilization really is, and I want students to understand their own needs and their own aims, but also the needs and yearnings of their neighbors. I want women free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves. I want our farmers growing crops to feed our Nation and the world, secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of us. I want workers to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country. And I want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new ideas. And I want minority citizens fully to join the mainstream of American life. And I want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our Nation, and Im determined to do it. I need for all of you to join me in fulfilling that vision. The choice, the choice between the two futures, could not be more clear. If we succumb to a dream world then well wake up to a nightmare. But if we start with reality and fight to make our dreams a reality, then Americans will have a good life, a life of meaning and purpose in a nation thats strong and secure. Above all, I want us to be what the Founders of our Nation meant us to become\\u2014the land of freedom, the land of peace, and the land of hope.
